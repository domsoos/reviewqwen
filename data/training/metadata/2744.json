    "review": "The noise cancellation works wonderfully, but I noticed the battery doesn\u2019t last as long as advertised when using ANC.",
    "Expected_output": "The buyer appreciates the noise cancellation but raises concerns about battery life not matching the advertised duration when using ANC. While the seller promises extended playtime, it's reasonable to expect lower battery life with ANC enabled. This seems to be a realistic observation rather than a direct fault.",
