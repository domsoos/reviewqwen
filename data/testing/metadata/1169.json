The band width is noted as 22mm, with adjustable perimeters to fit various wrist sizes. The watch dimensions, listed as 22 x 3.5 x 0.6 cm, suggest a sleek and lightweight design. Manufactured by Timewear & Beyond, the description emphasizes both style and practicality while providing customer support details for assistance.Buyer's Review Analysis:The buyer appreciates the watch's appearance, describing it as visually appealing. However, they express severe dissatisfaction with the belt quality, labeling it as very worst and criticizing its lack of durability. The buyer's review conveys disappointment with the materials used for the strap, overshadowing their satisfaction with the overall look.Discrepancies Identified:The seller's description does not provide detailed information about the belt material or its durability, which might have set buyer expectations. The buyer's experience with the poor belt quality directly contradicts the intended impression of a stylish and practical product, highlighting a gap in the seller's promises versus the buyer's reality.Conclusion:While the buyer finds the watch aesthetically pleasing, their dissatisfaction with the belt quality points to a significant shortfall in product durability. The fault lies with the seller for not adequately emphasizing or ensuring the quality of the strap material in their description. Buyer dissatisfaction is clear, rooted in a material defect rather than personal preference.",
