    "review": "The vacuum doesn't last anywhere near the promised 60 minutes of battery life. It barely works for 20 minutes before needing to be recharged.",
    "Expected-output": "The buyer is dissatisfied as the battery life does not match the seller's description of up to 60 minutes. The seller image and description emphasize long-lasting performance, but the buyer's experience contradicts this claim. Here, the fault lies with the seller for overstating the battery capabilities.",
