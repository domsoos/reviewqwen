The seller emphasizes its suitability as a stylish and functional accessory for daily use or special occasions, portraying it as a practical yet sophisticated choice.Seller's Images:The seller's images display a polished watch with a vibrant blue dial, cleanly aligned markers, and a shiny leather strap. The visuals emphasize the product's premium quality, appealing aesthetics, and attention to detail, particularly the brass case and high-contrast features. Buyer Review:The buyer comments on the watch's authenticity and practicality for daily use but notes that the leather belt is stiff, suggesting it may soften with time. The buyer also mentions that a different color combination, such as a white dial with a black strap, might enhance its appearance. Overall, the buyer seems content but provides constructive criticism about the watch's aesthetic options and initial strap stiffness. Buyer's Image:The buyer's image showcases the watch on their wrist, revealing that the product matches the seller's description in terms of design and dimensions.
