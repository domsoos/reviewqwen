    "review": "This device has been leaving rashes and small cuts on my skin since I started using it. Highly recommend NOT getting this product.",
    "expected-output": "The seller's description emphasizes a ComfortCut blade system that is designed for a gentle shave with minimal skin irritation, promoted under the Skin Protect technology. It claims rounded caps protect the blades, allowing them to glide smoothly over the skin. Additionally, it highlights features such as 4D Flex Heads for adaptive shaving on the contours of the face and neck, a pop-up trimmer, and a battery with a 40-minute runtime. The product is marketed as easy to clean with a pop-open head feature. However, the buyer's experience contrasts sharply with these promises. The customer review expresses dissatisfaction due to persistent rashes and small cuts after using the device, suggesting the shaver's performance falls short of providing the gentle and comfortable shave described. Furthermore, the photo provided by the buyer showing a rash on the neck and chin area supports this claim of irritation and discomfort, which contradicts the seller's assurance of a smooth and protective shave. This feedback from the buyer indicates that the shaver may not be suitable for sensitive skin, even though it is marketed as comfortable and protective. The issue does not seem to be a one-off fault but rather a shortcoming in the product's overall design or effectiveness in providing a gentle shave, at least for this customer. In conclusion, the discrepancy lies in the product's inability to deliver the advertised level of comfort and skin protection for the buyer, leading to dissatisfaction. The fault appears to be with the product's performance, not a mismatch in expectations, as the buyer anticipated a comfortable shave based on the advertised features. Therefore, potential customers with sensitive skin might consider this discrepancy carefully before purchase. The seller is at fault here, as the product did not fulfill the advertised ComfortCut system's promise of a gentle shave with minimal skin irritation. The buyer’s experience of rashes and cuts suggests that the product may not provide the level of comfort and skin protection as marketed, especially for those with sensitive skin. This discrepancy between advertised features and actual performance justifies the buyer’s dissatisfaction.",
