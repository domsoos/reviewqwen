    "review": "Ordered mutton flavour, got chicken flavour. Surprising thing is noticed only today as my dogs are eating eagerly where as mutton flavour does not interest them. Blindly in belief of Amazon, I did not verify as soon as item was delivered.",
    "expected-output": "The seller advertises the treats as made with real chicken, featuring a crunchy texture for oral health, enriched with Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids for a shiny coat, and free from added colors and flavors, fortified with vitamins and minerals for overall health. The treats are suitable for all breeds and life stages and come in convenient jar packaging. However, the buyer ordered mutton flavor but received chicken flavor instead. The discrepancy only became apparent later when the dogs showed an unexpected preference for the chicken flavor, which they typically do not prefer. The buyer trusted the fulfillment process and did not immediately verify the flavor upon delivery.The issue lies in a fulfillment or packaging error where the incorrect flavor was sent. While the product quality aligns with the seller's claims, the flavor mismatch impacted the buyerâ€™s satisfaction. This highlights a need for better flavor-specific labeling and fulfillment accuracy to prevent such issues. The fault lies with the fulfillment process for sending the wrong flavor. To enhance customer satisfaction, the seller should provide clearer flavor details in the product description and improve labeling or packaging to make flavor distinctions more prominent. Ensuring accurate order fulfillment would help maintain trust and reduce similar complaints in the future.",
