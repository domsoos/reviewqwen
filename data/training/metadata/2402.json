    "Expected_output": "The seller's description highlights the watch's classic digital design, featuring a silver-tone octagon-shaped dial, auto calendar, and green LED backlight. It promises a robust CR2016 battery with up to 7 years of performance, precise Japanese quartz movement, and water resistance up to 30 meters. The buyer review emphasizes satisfaction with the watch's aesthetic appeal and reliability. They appreciate the budget-friendly nature and functionality but mention that the manual lacks instructions for adjustments, which they found easy to resolve through online resources.
