    "review": "The biggest downside of multi vitamin pills are, they are typically very big and harder too shallow. These gummy vitamins by Nature Made solve that problem. The container contains 150 gummies and the serving size is 2 gummies per day. So you\u2019ll get a bit over 2 months worth of vitamins per container. Each gummy is the size of a candy gumdrop. The gummers are soft and easy to chew. They have a slight medicinal taste but the mixed berry flavoring does help reduce the bad aftertaste. These aren\u2019t too sweet either. Overall, if you\u2019re looking for a gummy vitamin that\u2019s formulated specifically for men then this is a good option.",
