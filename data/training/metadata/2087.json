    "seller_description": "Finding foods with lots of nutrients can be helpful for people who are trying to change their diet and live a better life. The word \u201cchia\u201d comes from the ancient Mayan word for strength. Why would the Mayans use such a powerful word for such a small seed? Well, chia seeds are loaded with nutrients such as fiber and omega-3 fatty acids. Our Organic Chia Seeds are nutrient powerhouses which is why they deserve to be associated with strength. They contain 37% of the daily recommended value of fiber to help the 97% of Americans who are fiber deficient. Because our chia seeds are flavor neutral and flavorless, you can add them to just about anything to get a boost without changing the taste of your food. Just mix our chia seeds with your favorite breakfast shake, smoothie, bread batter, or other food that could use a little extra crunch that your family will love! Use them as a pre- or post-workout boost with protein powders that you are already using. You can also sprinkle the seeds as a topping on yogurt, salads, or cereal for a satisfying snack! Our Organic Chia Seeds can also be used as an egg replacement when cooking or baking. Simply mix 1 tbs. of chia seeds with 3 tbs. of water, let sit for 5 minutes, and consume or bake immediately. You can then use this mixture as a vegan substitute in your favorite recipes. These Organic Chia Seeds are gluten-free, vegan, nut-free, raw, low-carb, non-GMO, and paleo-friendly, making them the perfect powerhouse for your pantry.
