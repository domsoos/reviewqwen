It features a 360-degree omni pickup pattern, ensuring clear and full audio capture from all directions.

For use with action cameras, customers need to purchase a TRRS to TRS Adapter to ensure compatibility. The microphone also features a one-button switch for easy mode selection between camera and smartphone use.",
    "review": "The cable length was insufficient for my recording setup, even though the product images suggest a long cable.",
    "Expected-output": "The buyer is dissatisfied with the cable length, which did not meet their expectations based on the product images. While the seller's description emphasizes compatibility and functionality, the perceived inconsistency in cable length between images and reality resulted in a negative experience.",
