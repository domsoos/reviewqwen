Seller Image The seller’s image displays a modern, ergonomic chair with a black mesh back, sturdy armrests, and a comfortable, cushioned seat. The image showcases its adjustability features, sleek design, and high-quality materials. Buyer Review The buyer expressed dissatisfaction, stating that they purchased the product on September 15, and after a month, the chair broke. The buyer mentioned that the build quality was \"extremely poor\" and that they were unable to claim the warranty on the product. They advised against purchasing the chair due to these issues. Buyer Image The buyer’s image reveals visible damage to the chair, specifically showing broken components, which supports the claim of poor build quality. Analysis and Conclusion The analysis of the seller's description, images, and buyer's feedback indicates a clear discrepancy between the seller’s promises and the buyer’s experience. The seller’s description emphasizes high durability, stability, and quality, claiming the chair is constructed with BIFMA-certified components and can withstand up to 100,000 cycles and a 100 kg load. However, the buyer’s review contradicts these claims, stating the chair broke within a month of purchase. This raises concerns about either the quality control of the product or a potential manufacturing defect that compromised durability. The seller is likely at fault in this case, as the product did not meet the durability standards specified in the description, and the warranty support appears inadequate if the buyer’s claim of inability to avail warranty is accurate. This situation suggests that the seller should ensure improved quality control and perhaps revisit the robustness of the warranty process to prevent similar issues and maintain customer trust.",
