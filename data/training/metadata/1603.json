    "expected-output": "The seller describes the BOYA BY-M1 microphone as a versatile, omni-directional device with 360-degree sound clarity, compatible with various devices and featuring a one-button switch for convenience. The seller's image showcases pristine packaging that aligns with this description, but the buyer’s image reveals a defective box, as noted in their review. Despite this packaging flaw, the buyer acknowledges the product is original and expresses overall satisfaction with their experience. While the defective box indicates a lapse in the seller’s quality control, the core product meets the promised specifications, leaving the buyer mostly satisfied. The fault lies with the seller for the defective packaging, but it does not significantly detract from the buyer's positive perception of the product.",
