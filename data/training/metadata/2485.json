    "seller_description": "Keep your beverages at the perfect temperature with the Ember Mug 2, designed to provide up to 80 minutes of consistent warmth (120\u00b0F to 145\u00b0F) or all-day heating on its charging coaster. Perfect for desk use or as a thoughtful gift, this smart mug ensures your drink stays just the way you like it. Use the Ember app to set precise temperatures and receive notifications, or enjoy standalone functionality with a default temperature of 135\u00b0F and memory of your last setting for a hassle-free experience. Equipped with auto-sleep and motion sensors, the mug wakes up when hot liquid is poured and sleeps when not in use, ensuring your drink is always ready. The scratch-resistant coating makes it safe for hand washing, and its IPX7 rating allows for full submersion up to 1 meter. A smart LED indicator lets you know when your drink has reached the perfect temperature. The Ember Mug 2 is an innovative, easy-to-use solution for keeping your favorite hot drinks at their best.",
    "review": "The app is clunky and disconnects frequently. It\u2019s almost impossible to adjust the temperature properly through the app as promised.",
    "Expected-output": "The buyer's review highlights technical issues with the app, which is a key feature emphasized in the seller's description. While the seller describes seamless temperature control through the Ember app, the buyer's experience reveals that the app's usability is subpar. This misalignment points to a fault in the software provided by the seller.",
