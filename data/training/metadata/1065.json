    "review": "Ordered mutton flavour, got chicken flavour. Surprising thing is noticed only today as my dogs are eating eagerly where as mutton flavour does not interest them. Blindly in belief of Amazon, I did not verify as soon as item was delivered.",
    "expected-output":"The seller provided a detailed description highlighting the nutritional benefits of the dog biscuits, including their composition with real chicken, vitamins, and Omega 3 and 6 fatty acids to support a lustrous coat and dental health, as well as the convenience of their jar packaging. The seller images display well-sealed jars with clearly labeled content. However, the buyer review reveals a significant discrepancy: the buyer ordered the mutton flavor but received the chicken flavor instead, which they only realized after observing their dogs' behavior. Despite the mismatch, the dogs enjoyed the chicken flavor, indicating the product quality met expectations, but the seller failed in ensuring the correct variant was delivered. This oversight highlights a fault on the seller's part in inventory or fulfillment accuracy, leading to a situation where the buyer's specific request was not honored. While the review reflects dissatisfaction regarding the flavor discrepancy, it does not criticize the product's overall quality. The seller should ensure stricter checks in packaging and order fulfillment to avoid such issues, as accurate delivery is crucial to maintaining customer trust.",
