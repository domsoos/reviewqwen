    "seller_description": "Keep your beverages at the perfect temperature with the Ember Mug 2, designed to provide up to 80 minutes of consistent warmth (120\u00b0F to 145\u00b0F) or all-day heating on its charging coaster. Perfect for desk use or as a thoughtful gift, this smart mug ensures your drink stays just the way you like it.

The scratch-resistant coating makes it safe for hand washing, and its IPX7 rating allows for full submersion up to 1 meter. A smart LED indicator lets you know when your drink has reached the perfect temperature. The Ember Mug 2 is an innovative, easy-to-use solution for keeping your favorite hot drinks at their best.",
    "review": "The air fryer arrived with scratches on the glass panel and a dent on the side, which was disappointing given the premium design described. Additionally, the upper basket handle felt loose after a few uses, making it difficult to maneuver.",
    "Expected-output": "The buyer's review highlights discrepancies with the seller's description of a 'durable' and 'premium design' appliance. The damaged glass panel and dent indicate issues with either shipping or manufacturing quality. The loose handle undermines the claim of effortless functionality, leading to buyer dissatisfaction. This fault lies with the seller as the product did not meet advertised standards.",
