    "review": "I don't even know where to begin on these things. But I'll start with the biggest issue. The fit is absolutely terrible. I wear a size 10.5 in every other pair of boots, shoes, slippers etc that I own. All the reviews said these shoes fit perfectly. Well that's absolutely incorrect. They fit like they are a size 10, my big toe hits the very end of the toe box, no wiggle room whatsoever. They are also extremely tight on the top of the foot and cut off circulation causing tingling and numbness in my toes within 10 minutes of just wearing them sitting down. The heel cup also doesn't even remotely cup properly, your heel will just slip up and down no matter how tight you sinch the laces. They also aren't as breathable as I thought they would be seeing as they are made of entirely of mesh. These shoes are an absolute joke. Do not trust the 4 and 5 star reviews because that's what I did and now I'm out of 40. You're better off going to Walmart and getting a cheap pair of shoes there. If I could give zero stars I would!",
    "expected_output": "Seller’s Description: The shoes are marketed as comfortable, breathable, and lightweight casual footwear suitable for all-day wear. The knitted upper is meant to enhance breathability, while the cushy EVA outsole and memory foam insole aim to provide cushioning and absorb impact. These shoes are described as versatile, pairing well with both casual and semi-formal attire. Additional features like an elasticated collar, lace-up design, and padded heel detail are intended to improve ease of wear and comfort. Buyer's Review: The buyer expressed significant dissatisfaction with the product. They noted that the fit was exceedingly tight and uncomfortable, even causing tingling and numbness in their toes after a short period of wear. The review also criticized the heel design, stating that it failed to hold the heel in place despite adjusting the laces. Contrary to the seller’s description of breathability, the buyer reported that the mesh material did not provide the expected airflow, leaving them feeling constrained. The buyer felt misled by positive reviews and expressed regret about the purchase, suggesting they could have found better value elsewhere. Visual Comparison: The seller’s images show a well-designed shoe with breathable mesh and a supportive structure. The buyer's photos confirm the product appearance matches the seller's images, with details like the mesh upper and lace-up design being accurate representations. Therefore, there is no discrepancy in appearance. Evaluation: Comfort and Fit: The primary issues raised by the buyer relate to fit and comfort. The buyer’s description of tightness, lack of heel support, and restricted toe space suggest that the sizing or shoe design may not accommodate a broad range of foot shapes or sizes. This misalignment is significant as it contradicts the seller's emphasis on all-day comfort. Breathability: Although marketed as highly breathable, the buyer found the mesh material inadequate for ventilation. This difference suggests that the material may not perform as effectively as promised in real-world conditions. Reliability of Reviews: The buyer’s disappointment with the reliability of positive reviews adds another layer of dissatisfaction, as they felt misled by these ratings. Conclusion: The buyer’s dissatisfaction seems justified based on their experience with fit, comfort, and breathability, which are key selling points in the description. The root of the issue likely lies with the product design or sizing standard, which did not accommodate the buyer’s needs despite being labeled as comfortable and breathable. Here, the fault lies more with the seller, as the product did not fulfill the comfort and sizing promises in the description. The buyer’s feedback reflects an expectation grounded in the seller's claims that were ultimately unmet.",
