    "review": "Sole is not perfect and durable",
    "expected-output": "The seller advertises these men's casual slip-on shoes as stylish, comfortable, and versatile, featuring a breathable mesh upper, lace-less closure, Pillo Foam outsole for impact cushioning, and Memory Foam insole for personalized comfort. They are promoted as durable, easy to maintain, and suitable for various occasions, from office wear to casual outings. However, the buyer expresses dissatisfaction, specifically criticizing the sole's poor quality and lack of durability, contradicting the seller's claims of long-lasting performance and cushioning. Images likely highlight this discrepancy, with the seller showcasing pristine, high-performance shoes and the buyer reporting visible wear on the soles. The buyer's experience suggests a failure in material quality or manufacturing, resulting in unmet expectations and a negative product experience. The fault lies with the seller or manufacturer for overstating the product's durability and performance capabilities.",
