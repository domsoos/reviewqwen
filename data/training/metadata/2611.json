    "review": "The cord length is too short for my kitchen setup. It should have come with an extension cord for better usability.",
    "Expected-output": "The seller\u2019s description does not specify the cord length or promise additional accessories such as an extension cord. The buyer\u2019s images confirm that the product is functional and matches the advertised design. The dissatisfaction arises from a mismatch between the buyer's specific needs and the product's standard features, which is not the seller\u2019s responsibility.",
