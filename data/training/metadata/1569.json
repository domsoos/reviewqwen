    "expected-output": " The seller promotes Whiskas Dry Cat Food as providing complete and balanced nutrition for adult cats aged one year and older, featuring a Tuna flavor enriched with 41 essential nutrients, including 23 vitamins and minerals. It is designed to support overall health with ingredients like Omega 6 and Zinc for a healthy coat, Vitamin A and Taurine for healthy eyesight, and Calcium, Phosphorus, and Vitamin D for strong teeth and bones. However, the buyer reported a concerning experience after purchasing the product in May, noting that one of their cats became sick and live worms were discovered inside some of the treats, raising significant issues about product safety and quality control. This finding directly contradicts the seller's claims of high-quality standards and nutritional safety. To address this, the seller needs to immediately investigate the issue, potentially recall affected batches, and improve quality control measures across manufacturing, packaging, and storage processes. Providing customer support by reaching out to the buyer with a resolution, such as a refund or replacement, and communicating corrective actions would be essential steps to rebuild trust and ensure the safety and quality of their products.",
