    "seller_description": "This stylish bag combines functionality and safety features with a sleek design. It includes a soft mesh back with 8mm foam padding for comfort, two main compartments, one slip-in pocket inside, a printed design, and a side mesh bottle holder. With dimensions of 35 x 13 x 46 cm, it offers ample space for organization. Please note, the bag is not water-resistant, making it ideal for everyday use in dry conditions.",
    "review": "Bag size is very small, no separate laptop compartment, front compartment is useless, just one compartment having some space but again no laptop compartment inside. Definitely this is not a 28-liter bag.",
    "expected_output": "The seller's image shows a sleek black backpack with a design similar to the one described in the seller's description, which includes a soft mesh back with foam padding, two main compartments, a slip-in pocket, a printed design, and a side mesh bottle holder. The buyer's image also depicts the same backpack, indicating that the product shown matches the description. However, the buyer's review expresses dissatisfaction with the bag, mentioning that the size is too small, there is no dedicated laptop compartment, and the front compartment is ineffective. The buyer also notes that the bag does not offer sufficient space, contrary to the seller's claim of 28 liters. The discrepancy seems to lie in the seller's description, which suggests ample space and functionality, but the buyer found the bag inadequate for their needs, particularly for carrying a laptop and organizing items efficiently. The fault appears to lie with the seller for not accurately describing the bag's size and compartmentalization, leading to the buyer's dissatisfaction.",
