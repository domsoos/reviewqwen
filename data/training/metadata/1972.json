    "expected-output": "The buyer expresses frustration with receiving a product of poor quality, particularly disappointed with the timing of the delivery during the Diwali period, when they were expecting high-quality service. The seller’s description presents the Skybags Stroke trolley as durable, lightweight, and impact-resistant, but the buyer’s experience does not align with these claims. The product appears to have fallen short of the buyer's expectations, leading to dissatisfaction, especially since the buyer needs the trolley for an upcoming trip. The fault seems to lie with the product not meeting the expected quality, possibly due to a defective or subpar item being shipped. The buyer’s frustration is directed toward both the product and the process, suggesting a negative experience with the order fulfillment.",
