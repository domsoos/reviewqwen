    "seller_description": "This pack of 6 Yonex Mavis shuttlecocks, made from durable nylon, delivers exceptional performance with a recovery time of just 0.02 seconds when smashed—only 0.005 seconds slower than Yonex feather shuttlecocks and 0.008 seconds faster than standard shuttlecocks. To ensure optimal performance, Yonex categorizes Mavis shuttlecocks into three temperature ranges; this pack features the green cap, indicating a slow speed suitable for playing environments between 22°C and 33°C. Manufactured with high-quality standards, these shuttlecocks originate from Japan.",
    "review": "They come without yonex seal. Wether it is original or duplicate.",
    "expected-output": "The seller advertises a pack of six Yonex Mavis 350 nylon shuttlecocks, highlighting their durability, fast recovery time of 0.02 seconds, and high performance close to feather shuttlecocks. The product is presented as made in Japan, adhering to high-quality standards, and includes a green cap indicating suitability for slow speed in environments between 22°C and 33°C. The seller's image accurately represents the product with bright yellow shuttlecocks in a tube and detailed descriptions of performance and material. However, the buyer's review raises concerns about the authenticity of the product, mentioning the absence of a Yonex seal and questioning whether the shuttlecocks are original or duplicates. The buyer’s image aligns with the seller’s visual representation, showing the same green cap and yellow nylon shuttlecocks, but the lack of a Yonex seal creates uncertainty. The discrepancy here lies in the buyer's doubt about authenticity, which is not addressed in the seller's description or images. While the seller provides detailed specifications and visual clarity, failing to mention the presence or absence of a seal contributes to the buyer's concern. The fault lies partly with the seller for not clearly addressing this aspect, as it impacts the buyer's confidence in the product. While the product may function as described, the perceived lack of authenticity creates dissatisfaction, leaving the buyer unsure of its quality. This highlights the importance of providing explicit details about brand authenticity to ensure buyer trust.",
