    "review": "I was so excited for this bag. It looked gorgeous in the pictures. I transferred very few items in it (so I did not obstruct the zipper) and I had a hard time closing it because the zipper did not work. It would close some and left gaps of opening. I have to pull real hard back and forth to get it unstuck. I'm very disappointed. It was poorly made with very cheap material and considering the price I did not expect the best, but I at least expected it to be functional and not fall apart in literally minutes of receiving and trying to use it.",
    "expected-output": "Alignment of Seller\u2019s Image and Buyer\u2019s Image: The seller's image shows a pristine, high-quality bag set with clean stitching, smooth edges, and well-placed zippers and hardware. The buyer's image also reflects this appearance, but the close-up provided in the second image shows a zipper that appears faulty or has gaps when closed, consistent with the buyer's complaint. 2. Description Details vs. Review Observations: Seller Description: Claims a high-quality synthetic leather with durable gold hardware and smooth zipper functionality. Advertises the set as well-made and functional, with reliable closures.Buyer Review:Reports that the zipper is difficult to use, does not close fully, and leaves gaps even when closed. Mentions disappointment due to the zipper's functionality issues and remarks that the material feels cheap, which contrasts with the seller's description of quality. 3. Discrepancies and Buyer Satisfaction: Discrepancies: The primary discrepancy is between the advertised quality and smooth functionality of the zipper versus the buyer's experience of a faulty zipper that requires force to operate. The buyer also notes the bag feels cheaply made, which contradicts the seller's description of \"high quality\" synthetic leather and sturdy construction. Satisfaction: The buyer is dissatisfied due to the zipper malfunction, which rendered the bag difficult to use shortly after receiving it. This dissatisfaction stems from the bag not meeting functional expectations set by the seller. 4. Conclusion: The seller\u2019s product did not meet the buyer's expectations due to a functional defect with the zipper and perceived material quality that did not align with the description. The fault appears to lie with the product\u2019s quality rather than a subjective opinion of the buyer.\" The seller is at fault due to a quality control issue, as the zipper malfunction and perceived lower material quality did not meet the buyer's expectations for a high-quality, functional product as advertised. This led to buyer dissatisfaction.",
