    "review": "The last picture is these headphones next to my Sony Wh-1000XM4s. Vibeadio on the left, Sony on the right.The vibeadio headphones are light but not in a cheap way. The sound quality is lovely. I keep my fan at the highest level around this time of year and the active noise cancellation managed to mask it. It definitely cancels out stomping and floor creaks if you live in an apartment.It was easy to connect the headphones to my MacBook Pro. It literally connected in less than a second. It was charged up to 90% straight out the box.It\u2019s big head friendly. It\u2019s a little snug right now but I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll loosen up as I use them more. No ear pain after hours of use.The performance is great, especially for the price. If you\u2019re looking for a more affordable option compared to major brands, get these. I have a pair of Sony WHs so my expectations were low, but I was pleasantly surprised.\u200b",
