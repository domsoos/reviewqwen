    "expected-output": "The seller describes the polybags as available in various sizes, including 8x10 inches, with durable, self-adhesive, tear-resistant, and waterproof features. The buyer ordered a pack of 100 bags in the 16x12 inch size but received only 51 bags. The buyer is dissatisfied and wishes to exchange or return the product. The discrepancy in the number of bags received indicates a fulfillment error on the seller's part, making the seller responsible for the issue.",
