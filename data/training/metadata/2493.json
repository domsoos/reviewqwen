    "review": "The keyboard tray feels flimsy and cannot support the promised weight capacity. It bent slightly under moderate use.",
    "Expected-output": "The seller advertises the tray as ergonomically efficient and capable of supporting up to 5 lbs. The buyer's review and image showing bending contradict this claim. The seller is at fault for misrepresenting the tray\u2019s structural integrity.",
