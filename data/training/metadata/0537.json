    "review": "The material feels pretty low quality, like it may get nubby pretty quickly. However, the dress is extremely comfortable and lightweight. It feels like you're wearing nothing at all. The style of this dress does absolutely nothing to flatter a figure, so keep that in mind. It pretty much makes you look like a box with no waist definition, but the cuteness of the print/colors and the comfort of this dress is why I'm still giving it 3 stars. I'd probably actually give it 5 stars if it was about half the cost. It's definitely overpriced for the subpar quality. I'm 5 feet 5 inches, 36/C, 128 lbs, 27 inches waist and 38 inches hips.

    "expected-output": "Visual Appearance: Seller’s Image: The dress in the seller's image shows a vibrant floral print with ruffled sleeves and a tiered skirt design. It has a loose, flowy fit, which aligns with the description of a boho midi dress. Buyer’s Image: The dress looks similar in print and design to the seller's image. The floral pattern, ruffled sleeves, and loose silhouette match what was advertised, showing that the visual appearance is consistent with the seller’s description. Product Quality and Description Alignment: Seller Description: The seller describes the dress as a “casual loose style” with “charming ruffled sleeves,” “loose fit,” and a “ruched and pleated skirt.” They emphasize comfort and versatility, suggesting it as a stylish, year-round wardrobe staple made of 35% Rayon, 60% Polyester, and 5% Spandex. However, there's no indication of the fabric quality or thickness. Buyer Review: The buyer mentions the dress is comfortable and lightweight, aligning with the seller's claim of a loose, flowy style. However, the buyer criticizes the fabric quality, describing it as “low quality” and mentioning that it might wear out quickly (“get nubby”). The buyer also states that the dress lacks waist definition, giving a “boxy” appearance, which suggests that the loose fit may not flatter all body types as expected. They feel the dress is overpriced given the quality. Buyer Satisfaction: Satisfaction Level: The buyer is somewhat dissatisfied with the dress due to the fabric quality and lack of figure-flattering design but appreciates the comfort and print. They gave it 3 stars, indicating a mixed opinion. Root Cause of Dissatisfaction: The dissatisfaction stems from the perceived low-quality fabric and the lack of a flattering fit, which the buyer feels does not justify the price. This suggests a gap between the product’s quality and the buyer’s expectation based on the cost. Conclusion: The product's appearance aligns well with the advertised image, and the buyer received a dress visually consistent with what was shown. However, there’s a quality discrepancy as the buyer perceives the material to be of lower quality than expected, given the price. While the seller describes the dress as “flowy” and “loose,” the buyer finds the fit too boxy and unflattering, which was not emphasized in the seller’s description. \" The seller is not completely at fault due to a discrepancy in the perceived quality and fit of the dress. While the visual appearance matches the description, the fabric quality and fit did not meet the buyer's expectations, leading to mixed satisfaction. Adding more detail on fabric quality and fit in the description could help set clearer expectations.",
