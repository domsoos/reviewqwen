    "review": "Apple AirTags are simply the most reliable tracking devices I've used. I initially tried several competitors, but their performance was disappointing\u2014most of their batteries died within months. In contrast, my first AirTag lasted for over six months without any issues. The consistent reliability and ease of use made a noticeable difference in my daily life. Although AirTags are a bit more expensive than other options, the quality and peace of mind they provide are well worth the price. I ended up purchasing more because I trust them to keep track of my important items without fail.",
