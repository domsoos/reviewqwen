    "review": "Extremely comfortable to hold, silky smooth on surfaces, and a great bang for your buck. Feels sturdy for the price/doesn't feel cheap and gives a satisfying audible click. Came with a free battery too which was a nice bonus. Only complaint is that it's a little small for my liking, but that's moreso a personal issue since the M185 was labeled for mid to smaller hands and mine are on the larger side. Overall, very satisfied with it!",
