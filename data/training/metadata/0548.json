    "review": "This is a great belt! I feel like I finally found my fashion groove with this belt. It is easy to close but will not come undone. And the design adds that little extra to outfits. I am so happy to have found this belt. I ordered the coffee   brown two-belt package because I was worried the colors would be off in the photos and I wasn't sure which brown would look best with the dress I planned to wear it with. First, let me say that the colors in the pictures are pretty accurate. 'Coffee' is a dark brown and 'brown' is more of a light brown/dark tan color. After reading the extremely varied reviews about the fit of the belts, I was very nervous to choose. I am 5 foot 6 inches and weigh about 205 lbs., with most of my weight in my stomach. I ordered the XL (and worried they would be too small). The belt fit around my waist with very little stretch the first time I wore it, and I thought I might order the next size down for the next colors I wanted. But after wearing it 2-3 times, I realized that it didn't even have to stretch to reach around my waist. The belt had stretched permanently after just a couple times wearing it. (See picture -- I have not worn the lighter brown belt yet.). This is a stretchy belt, so it is to be expected that this will happen. I'm not really complaining; I just wanted to make buyers aware of this. I would buy a size down than what you expect will fit you. Not just because it will likely fit you anyway, but because the belts will stretch with wear. Hope this helps. Good luck!",
    "expected-output": "Visual Appearance: The seller’s images display the belts with a braided design, made from a combination of polyester, spandex, and faux leather materials, giving the belts a textured, durable look. The buyer’s images match the seller's in terms of design and texture. The colors appear as expected based on the seller's images, with distinctions between the \"coffee\" and \"brown\" belts aligning with the buyer’s description (dark brown for coffee and a lighter brown for brown). Details and Description Alignment: The seller claims the belts are stretchy with a 3-inch wide band for a snug fit around the waist. The buyer confirms the stretchiness but notes that the belts stretch out quickly, suggesting that they may lose their snug fit with repeated use. This aspect might not have been emphasized in the seller’s description, which could lead to some dissatisfaction over long-term fit. The buyer appreciates the ease of closure, a feature not explicitly mentioned by the seller, which adds a positive note to the functionality. Buyer Satisfaction: The buyer expresses general satisfaction with the belt's appearance, functionality, and ease of closure, indicating they are pleased with the aesthetic and functionality. However, they also mention a minor drawback: the belts stretch out permanently after only a few wears. This could affect future fit, leading to a slightly lower satisfaction level regarding durability. Conclusion: The buyer is generally satisfied with the purchase, appreciating the belt's appearance, color accuracy, and functionality. The stretching issue could be seen as a design flaw, particularly if the buyer expects the belt to maintain its snug fit. This minor dissatisfaction is due to the natural behavior of elastic materials rather than a fault in product quality.\" The seller is not completely at fault for not fully disclosing the potential for the belts to lose their snug fit with repeated use. While the buyer is generally satisfied with the appearance, color accuracy, and functionality, the stretching issue led to minor dissatisfaction regarding long-term durability.",
