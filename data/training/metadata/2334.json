    "review": "My husband is very happy with this helmet. His modular helmet he was using previously was truly a fine helmet, but it was twice as heavy. Not worried about performance after a crash as in some reviews, my hubby would replace any helmet that's been in a wreck. So we are happy & will only update if that changes!",
