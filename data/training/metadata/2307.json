    "review": "The product is genuine bandaid product. I think everyone has used band-aid brand bandaids atleast once in their lives before. They are made with quality material and the adhesive holds up even when wet. They won't fall off after getting wet and don't come off until you are ready to remove. The material doesn't hurt my skin and I have very sensitive skin that plastic bandaids have caused rips and irritations to in the past. The price here is outstanding. I will never waste time grabbing these in-store again. Repeat customer here for life as long as the price stays right",
