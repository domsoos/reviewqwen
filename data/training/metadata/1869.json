    "expected-output": "The seller's description claims that the earplugs are designed for ear protection, noise reduction, and comfort, with a Noise Reduction Rating (NRR) of 29 decibels. However, the buyer's review states that the product is a fake and does not come in authentic 3M packaging, suggesting a discrepancy between what was advertised and what was received. The buyer is dissatisfied with the product, accusing it of being a counterfeit. This points to a significant issue with the seller's authenticity, as the buyer did not receive the expected branded product. The fault lies with the seller for either misrepresenting the product or delivering a counterfeit item instead of the genuine 3M product as expected.",
