    "review": "Havent used the product yet but very first impression is that it looks very small not more than 2.5 in diameter.looked bigger in the seller pics.very misleading.is 40gms though as mentioned.",
    "expected_output": "The seller's images and description portray the product as a high-quality car air freshener with a musk aroma, suitable for dashboard or cupholder placement. The product is described as containing 40 grams and intended for efficient fragrance distribution. The buyer's review highlights their dissatisfaction with the product's size, which they found significantly smaller than expected, citing it as 'not more than 2.5 inches in diameter.' However, the weight of the product matches the seller's claim of 40 grams. This discrepancy indicates that the seller's visual representation in the images may have given an exaggerated impression of the product's size, potentially misleading the buyer. The buyer has not yet used the product, so their judgment pertains solely to first impressions rather than performance. The fault lies primarily with the seller for not providing clearer indications of the product's dimensions in their images, which led to a mismatch in buyer expectations. Improved clarity in marketing visuals could help prevent such issues in the future.",
