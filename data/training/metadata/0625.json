    "review": "I love this little pot for cooking my lunch. It boils water quickly for ramen, and is great for some stir fry action or reheating leftovers. The coating in the pan makes it super easy to wipe clean after each use and also helps any food not stick on it (including even eggs). This is great to use in a small space but take note that the plug-in requires a grounded outlet, so if the outlet in your space doesn't have that 3rd hole to plug something in then you'll need to also get a solution for that when you buy this.",
