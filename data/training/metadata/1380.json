This highlights a durability issue with the internal structure of the bag.Missing Dual Zipper: The buyer also mentions that the dual zipper feature should have been included, suggesting that a single zipper might not be as practical or durable for the bag's compartments. Analysis of the Images Buyer\u2019s Image: Likely shows the bag in use, possibly showing the area where the inner lining gave way or the bag's overall wear and tear after about a month of use. Seller\u2019s Image:Depicts the bag, emphasizing its compartments, zippers, and design. The image does not reflect the durability issue with the inner lining or the lack of a dual zipper. Discrepancies Identified 1. Durability Issue: The inner lining separating compartments gave away after a month of use, which contradicts the seller\u2019s claim of high-quality, durable materials. This points to a possible quality control issue with the internal structure of the bag.2.Missing Dual Zipper: The bag is equipped with a single zipper, while the buyer suggests a dual zipper would have been more practical, especially for durability. Conclusion The buyer is generally satisfied with the sporting bag's functionality and design but highlights a significant durability issue with the inner lining. The missing dual zipper is also noted as a drawback for practical use. The seller should address the durability of the inner lining and consider offering a dual zipper option for better functionality and customer satisfaction.",
