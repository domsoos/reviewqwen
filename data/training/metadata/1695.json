    "review": "I had first purchased the smaller package and was super pleased with the product and decided to get a larger one. The slime had come in a plastic container with a broken cap and it does not resemble the packaging shown in the product photo. Good product but the packaging is crappy.",
    "expected-output": "The buyer's review indicates a mixed experience with the Universal Car Cleaning Gel. While the buyer is pleased with the gel's performance, as it effectively cleans hard-to-reach areas like vents and cup holders, they express dissatisfaction with the packaging. The buyer mentions that the larger package came in a plastic container with a broken cap, which did not match the product's advertised packaging in the seller's image. This discrepancy between the seller's packaging representation and the received product leads to the buyer's disappointment. The product itself, however, functions as promised in the seller’s description, with no issues noted regarding its cleaning abilities. The issue here lies with the packaging, which appears to have been damaged during shipping or was not as depicted. The fault for this discrepancy lies with the seller's fulfillment or packaging process, not with the product itself. Therefore, the seller is at fault regarding the packaging, but the product is still considered effective and in line with the seller's description.",
