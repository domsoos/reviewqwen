    "review": "I ordered this product of 2TB capacity but actually its only 1.81 TB that is short 19 GB.. Its surprise for me..",
    "expected-output":"The seller’s description accurately advertises a 2TB SSD with specified read/write speeds, hardware encryption, and durability features, without indicating that the user would see the full 2TB in all system measurements. The buyer, however, expresses dissatisfaction upon discovering that the drive shows only 1.81TB of usable space—an industry-standard occurrence due to file system formats and the binary vs. decimal representation of storage capacity. While the buyer is surprised and disappointed, there is no indication that the seller’s claims are false or that the product differs from typical SSD specifications. From a neutral standpoint, the seller has not misrepresented the drive’s total capacity; instead, the buyer’s discontent arises from a common misunderstanding of how storage sizes are reported. Therefore, the fault does not lie with the seller.",
