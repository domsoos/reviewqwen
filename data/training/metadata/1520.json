    "expected-output": "The seller advertises Pedigree Wet Dog Food as a complete and balanced meal with real chicken, high-quality protein, and nutrients like Omega 6, zinc, protein, calcium, and fiber to promote hydration, muscle and bone health, digestive well-being, and a shiny coat. However, the buyer reports dissatisfaction due to receiving the product in an open condition and missing one out of 30 sachets, indicating a packaging or delivery issue rather than a problem with the productâ€™s quality. This highlights a logistical shortcoming that impacts customer satisfaction. To address this, the seller should improve packaging processes to ensure all items are securely packed and accounted for, verify inventory accuracy before shipping, and provide a prompt resolution, such as a replacement or refund, to rebuild customer trust.",
