    "expected-output": "The seller describes the 38-inch Acoustic Guitar as a high-quality product with a black glossy finish, an 18-fret design, and a durable construction featuring Linden wood and ebony wood components. It is marketed as providing a smooth playing experience with accurate pitch tuning and a bright, resonant tone. The complete package, including a strap, bag, string set, and picks, is positioned as suitable for beginners and experienced players. The seller’s image portrays a well-crafted and premium product consistent with these claims.However, the buyer’s review highlights significant dissatisfaction, stating that the guitar was broken upon delivery and is not even properly attached. The buyer mentions having proof of the damage, which directly contradicts the seller’s claims of durability and quality. This indicates either a manufacturing defect or poor handling during shipping. The review reflects a stark discrepancy between the seller’s description of a durable, well-constructed product and the buyer’s actual experience of receiving a damaged item.Conclusion:The buyer is highly dissatisfied due to receiving a broken guitar, which directly undermines the seller’s claims of durability and quality. The fault lies with the seller, either for failing to ensure the product’s quality during manufacturing or for inadequate packaging that led to damage during transit. This situation highlights the need for improved quality control and better shipping practices to ensure that the product meets the advertised standards and arrives in good condition. Enhanced packaging and pre-shipping inspections could prevent similar issues in the future and improve customer satisfaction.",
