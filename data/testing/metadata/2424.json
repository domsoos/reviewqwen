    "seller_description": "Yonex precision MAVIS Nylon shuttlecocks are the closest you can get to traditional feather. Designed to have the same flight time as a feather shuttle, they give an accurate and durable performance with a traditional feel. Players should always use the shuttlecocks best suited to the playing environment. The hardness of the skirt \u2013 the feather part of the nylon shuttlecock \u2013 varies depending on temperature. In the cold, as the skirt becomes hard, it is prone to breaking. In the hot, the skirt becomes softer and less likely to break, but the feel at impact is affected by the softer skirt. YONEX manages product quality by categorising MAVIs into 3 temperatures. Please ensure that you choose the shuttlecock best suited to the playing environment. Color of the cap - Proper speed- Range of temperature: Green \u2013 slow \u2013 22-33 C Blue \u2013 middle \u2013 12-23 C Red \u2013 fast \u2013 0-13 C Shuttlecocks should be stored away from high temperatures and the tube kept upright with the cork side of the shuttlecock facing down",

Recently I started playing badminton in court and looking for a shuttle with good flight time though it slows a little mid air otherwise its a good product for beginners and mid level players as well also shuttle lasts long.....bought it at good price in amazon great indian sale... If you are also looking for a shuttle don't think much its a genuine product with best quality.",
