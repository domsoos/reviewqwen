    "expected-output":"The seller describes the Xiaomi Trimmer 2C as a high-precision grooming tool with 0.5mm accuracy, 40 length settings, a 90-minute runtime, and Type-C charging. It is marketed as durable, travel-friendly, and including washable attachments, a cleaning brush, and a pouch. The seller’s images depict a sleek, functional design with all components intact and ready for use. The buyer’s review, however, highlights a significant issue—a broken blade on the left side that cannot fit into the machine. The buyer’s image confirms this defect, showing a damaged blade that undermines the product's usability. This discrepancy indicates a failure in quality control or packaging from the seller's side, as the product arrived in a non-functional state. The buyer is justified in their dissatisfaction as the product failed to meet the basic expectations of functionality and durability. The fault lies with the seller for delivering a defective product, contradicting the claims of reliability and precision outlined in the description.",
