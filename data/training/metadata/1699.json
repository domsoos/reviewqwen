It is finely tuned with a Tanpura to ensure accurate notes, providing a rich and harmonious sound. The Bansuri requires no maintenance as it is washable, resistant to the effects of direct sunlight, and remains durable with no cracks or splits even after aging or drops from up to 8 feet in height. An extra hole is included to enable playing of both Lower and Higher Tivra Ma, perfect for use in Gamak and Meend. The yellow color finish closely resembles the traditional bamboo Bansuri. Additionally, the included Bansuri manual provides essential information such as how to hold the instrument, play scales, finger positioning, and tips on care and maintenance, making it a perfect choice for both beginners and experienced players.",
    "review": "Yes it's mislead beginners too. Tho Sound quality is good but it irritates by improper notes. Don't buy totally waste of money.",
    "expected-output": "The buyer’s review expresses dissatisfaction with the Bansuri flute, stating that although the sound quality is good, the instrument produces improper notes, which can irritate beginners. The buyer implies that the Bansuri might mislead those new to learning the instrument, ultimately labeling it as a waste of money. The seller’s description, however, highlights the flute’s easy-to-play Lip-Plate design, its ability to produce accurate notes, and its suitability for beginners. It also emphasizes that the Bansuri is finely tuned with a Tanpura, providing a rich, harmonious sound, which contradicts the buyer’s experience with improper notes.In terms of visual alignment, both the seller’s and buyer’s images show the same yellow-colored Bansuri flute, indicating consistency in the product’s appearance. However, the dissatisfaction with the flute’s performance, specifically regarding the improper notes, suggests that the product may not have met the buyer's expectations or the seller’s claims about the ease of playing and accurate sound production.The discrepancy lies in the performance of the instrument as described by the seller versus the experience shared by the buyer. The fault here seems to be with the product's quality and performance, not the buyer’s expectations. The seller’s description promised an easy-to-play, well-tuned flute suitable for beginners, but the buyer’s experience contradicts this, indicating that the flute may not have been tuned properly or might not have met the expected standards for beginners. As such, the fault appears to lie with the seller in providing a product that failed to deliver on the promises made regarding sound quality and ease of use for beginners.",
