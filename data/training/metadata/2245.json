    "seller_description": "The upgraded motion sensor under cabinet lights offer enhanced functionality with auto-on motion detection within 120\u00b0 and 10ft in dark or low-light environments, automatically turning off after about 20 seconds of no movement. This eliminates the need to fumble for switches in the dark, preventing accidents. Additionally, these lights can be set to always-on mode for continuous use during the day or for tasks like reading, camping, or as a flashlight. Featuring 40 energy-efficient LEDs and a non-glare frosted cover, these dimmable lights offer 5 brightness levels, providing flexibility for both bright task lighting and softer night lighting without disturbing others. The lights are USB-C rechargeable with a built-in 1800mAh battery, offering up to 30 days of use in motion sensor mode or 8 hours in always-on mode at full brightness. With easy installation via strong magnets or adhesive metal plates, they\u2019re perfect for use in the kitchen, closets, cupboards, pantry, basement, stairs, hallways, and more, with no need for an electrician.",
    "review": "Who knew that lights could redefine my pantry experience? These motion sensor lights are like having a little magician illuminating my secret snack stash every time I sneak in for cookies at midnight! My toddler now thinks the pantry is a spaceship. It's a whole new vibe!",
    "Expected-output": "The buyer\u2019s experience with the motion sensor lights appears to be overwhelmingly positive, as depicted by the clear and well-lit spaces shown in the images of various installations like closets and under-cabinet areas. These align perfectly with the seller\u2019s promise of easy installation using magnetic or adhesive options. Additionally, the description accurately portrays the 5 brightness levels and USB-C rechargeability, which buyers seem to have utilized effectively. While the reviews are uniquely creative and unrelated to the intended function, they inadvertently highlight the product's versatility, especially for aesthetic and functional adaptations. The satisfaction expressed strongly supports the seller\u2019s claims, with no discrepancies evident.",
