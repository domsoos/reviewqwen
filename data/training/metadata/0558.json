    "expected-output": "Seller Image vs. Buyer Image: Seller Image: Displays a package of 12 boxes of \"Ritz Hint of Salt\" crackers, showcasing a low-sodium choice. Buyer Image: Shows \"Ritz Garlic Butter\" crackers, which differ from the advertised \"Hint of Salt\" variety. Seller Description: Describes \"Ritz Hint of Salt\" crackers as a low-sodium choice with 25 mg of sodium per serving, ideal as a standalone snack or paired with toppings. It specifies the package contains 12 boxes of the \"Hint of Salt\" variety. Buyer Review: The review does not explicitly mention a dissatisfaction but reflects excitement about finding a long-lost favorite product in bulk online. The buyer expresses enthusiasm over having a large supply, presumably of their intended variety. Discrepancy: There is a clear mismatch between the product shown in the seller\u2019s image and description (\"Hint of Salt\") and what the buyer received (\"Garlic Butter\"). The review does not acknowledge this discrepancy, possibly because the buyer hasn\u2019t noticed or prioritized their enthusiasm over the received flavor.\" The seller is at fault for a fulfillment error, as there is a mismatch between the advertised \"Hint of Salt\" crackers and the \"Garlic Butter\" variety that the buyer received. Although the buyer did not express dissatisfaction, the discrepancy indicates a mistake in product delivery.",
