    "review": "From the last 1 year it has gone so dry and unchewable. My dog doesn't like to eat it and his mouth gets sore and bleeding.",
    "expected-output": " The seller promotes Munchy Sticks as chicken-flavored treats supporting dental health by reducing tartar build-up while being long-lasting and safe for dogs over three months old. However, the buyer reports that the treats became dry and unchewable over a year, causing their dog mouth soreness and bleeding. This directly contradicts the seller's claims of being a satisfying and safe chew. To address these issues, the seller should investigate storage or manufacturing processes to prevent dryness, ensure health safety by revising the formulation, and offer customer support through refunds or replacements while addressing feedback for consistent quality.",
