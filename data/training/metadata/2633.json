    "seller_description": "The Control D Nebulizer is designed to provide effective nebulization for the entire family, featuring both adult and child-sized masks for easier inhalation. With a medication capacity of 5 ml and a power requirement of 230 V AC, 50 Hz, and 75 W power consumption, it ensures efficient atomization of medication into fine particles, allowing for more effective delivery to the respiratory tract. It does not work with water; instead, it converts medication into a mist that is inhaled at room temperature through the mask. The nebulizer comes with a 12-month warranty from the date of invoice. It\u2019s important to note that nebulizers convert medicine into mist, while steamers convert water into hot steam, and these two products should not be confused, as they serve different respiratory care purposes.",
    "review": "The device is quite bulky and difficult to carry during travel, despite the product description not mentioning portability as a feature.",
    "Expected-output": "The buyer review mentions the nebulizer being bulky and hard to carry while traveling. However, the seller\u2019s description does not claim the product is portable or travel-friendly. The buyer\u2019s dissatisfaction seems to stem from a personal assumption about the product\u2019s features, which is irrelevant to the seller\u2019s claims. Here, the fault lies with the buyer\u2019s misunderstanding, as the product was accurately described by the seller.",
