    "review": "I was SO excited to get me earrings UNTIL I REALIZED PAVOI SENT ME A COMPLETELY EMPTY BOX. How do you let this happen??? I don't even have an item to return to get my refund BECAUSE THEY NEVER SENT ME AN ITEM TO BEGIN WITH AND STILL CHARGED ME. Absolutely ridiculous.",
    "expected-output": "Seller's Description: The product is advertised as double huggie hoop earrings made of yellow gold-plated material with a latch back. The earrings are intended to provide a lasting, brilliant finish and come with a 60-day satisfaction guarantee, with a promise of sustainable practices. Seller's Image: The images showcase a pair of earrings with a sleek, double-hoop design in gold or rose gold plating, matching the description of the advertised item. Buyer's Image: The buyer's photo reveals the packaging with a PAVOI logo but lacks the actual product. It shows an empty jewelry box and accompanying materials, confirming the buyer\u2019s claim of not receiving the item. Buyer's Review: The buyer expresses extreme dissatisfaction due to receiving an empty box without the earrings. They feel misled and charged without getting the product, with no item available to return for a refund. Discrepancies: The main discrepancy is the absence of the product in the buyer\u2019s package. The seller\u2019s description promises earrings, but the buyer only received an empty box, indicating a significant delivery or fulfillment error. Conclusion: The buyer is understandably dissatisfied because they did not receive the item. This issue is due to a fulfillment or packaging error on the seller\u2019s part, leading to a failed customer experience and the need for resolution, ideally through a replacement or refund. \" The seller is at fault due to a fulfillment or packaging error, as the buyer received an empty box instead of the earrings, leading to extreme dissatisfaction and a failed customer experience.",
