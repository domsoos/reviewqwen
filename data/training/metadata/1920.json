    "review": "Not a worth for 100rs which is sold at public junction",
    "expected-output": "The seller's description promises a stylish and functional leather wallet with RFID protection, six card slots, two currency slots, and three transparent sections. The buyer's image shows a wallet that aligns with the seller\u2019s description in terms of design and general appearance, confirming the seller's promise regarding the product's size and structure. However, the buyer's review expresses dissatisfaction, stating that the wallet is not worth its price of 100 INR, particularly due to it being sold at a public junction, suggesting that the buyer feels the value doesn't match the price. The buyer does not seem to have an issue with the wallet's functionality or features but is disappointed with its perceived value. The discrepancy lies in the perceived value for money rather than the actual product itself, which aligns with the seller's description and image. Therefore, the issue appears to be more about the pricing and marketing rather than a flaw in the product itself. In this case, the buyer's dissatisfaction stems from the perceived overpriced nature of the wallet, which may not be entirely the fault of the seller, but rather the marketing context and pricing expectations.",
