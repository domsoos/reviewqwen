    "review": "A very horrible product and quality is poor as well. Due to in rush I couldnâ€™t check when delivered and now lost all the tags and bills. Please help with it.",
    "expected-output": "The buyer's review expresses dissatisfaction with the quality of the product, calling it horrible and poor, which contrasts sharply with the seller's description of the bag as durable, spacious, and ideal for outdoor activities. The buyer also mentions that they could not check the product upon delivery due to being in a rush, and now they are unable to return or address the issue due to the lack of tags and bills. This indicates that the product did not meet the buyer's expectations, and the fault lies with the product's quality, as promised by the seller, which is not in line with the buyer's experience.",
