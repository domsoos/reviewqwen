    "seller_description": "To operate the multimeter with a square wave output of 50Hz and 3Vp-p, first ensure the output jack is labeled V ohm mA and COM for proper connections. For testing the magnification ratio of a transistor, set the switch to the hFE position and insert the transistor into the eight-hole jack. When measuring DC voltage, AC voltage, DC current, resistance, diode, buzzer, or battery, connect the red test lead to the V 0 mA jack and the black test lead to the COM jack. If measuring current above 200mA, switch the red test lead to the OADC jack and the black lead to the COM jack. For temperature measurements, connect the temperature probe to either the V 0 mA or COM jack. Always refer to the attached instruction manual for detailed operating guidelines.",
    "review": "Don't Buy this product.Do bar order karake same problem aaya a waste of money.....",
    "expected-output": "The seller's description provides a clear and comprehensive set of instructions on how to operate the multimeter, detailing its various functions and settings. However, the buyer\u2019s review expresses frustration with the product, stating that it was a waste of money and implies that they faced the same issue with the product as with a previous order, although the specific problem is not clearly defined. The review is highly negative, but without specifying the exact issue, it is difficult to pinpoint whether the problem lies with the product's functionality, quality, or something else.The review does not provide clear details about any discrepancies between the product's description and the buyer's experience. Therefore, it\u2019s unclear if the dissatisfaction stems from a defect or poor performance of the multimeter or simply from the buyer\u2019s expectations not being met.Since the review lacks specifics and only mentions a vague issue (same problem), it's difficult to definitively conclude the fault. However, the buyer\u2019s overall dissatisfaction suggests there may be an underlying issue with the product's performance or quality that was not adequately addressed by the seller\u2019s description. The lack of a specific explanation could also indicate that the buyer's dissatisfaction is based on personal expectation rather than a clear product defect.",
