This versatile planter also makes a fun and thoughtful gift for family and friends, bringing a touch of humor and personality to any setting.",
    "review": "The arm of the planter broke within a day of use. This was supposed to be a durable product, but the material feels flimsy and weak.",
    "Expected-output": "The buyer's image of the broken planter contradicts the seller's promise of durability in the product description. The seller's images depict a robust design, which was not delivered. The fault is with the seller for not ensuring product durability.",
    "label": "-1 buyers opinion"
