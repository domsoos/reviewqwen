    "review": "The night vision is extremely poor, with headlights causing significant glare. The G-sensor does not lock videos as claimed, leading to loss of important footage.",
    "Expected-output": "The seller emphasized superior night vision and reliable G-sensor functionality for collision detection and video locking. However, the buyer's review and images show excessive glare and confirm that the G-sensor failed to lock critical footage, contradicting the advertised features. The dissatisfaction is due to the failure of key functionalities, making the seller responsible for the issues encountered.",
