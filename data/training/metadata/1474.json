    "review": "Does a decent job on a black shoe but barely makes any difference on a white shoe with mesh.",
    "expected-output": "The seller advertises TCCO disposable shoe cleaner wipes as effective for cleaning various shoe materials, including white sneakers and mesh, while emphasizing portability, safety, and versatility for footwear and leather accessories. However, the buyer's review reveals a limitation, noting the wipes work well on black shoes but are ineffective on white shoes with mesh, contrary to the seller's claims. Images likely highlight this discrepancy, with the seller showcasing pristine results on white mesh shoes, while the buyer's image suggests residual dirt or grime. This inconsistency points to an overgeneralization of the wipes' capabilities, leading to partial dissatisfaction as the product fails to meet expectations for all advertised surfaces, particularly white mesh shoes.",
