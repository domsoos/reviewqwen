    "expected-output": "Seller's Image and Description: The seller’s images display a beige polypropylene plastic table with a simple, modern design, including wheels for mobility and an additional storage tray under the tabletop. The table appears to be lightweight and functional, matching the description provided. The seller’s description emphasizes the table’s construction from \"100% polypropylene plastic,\" noting its durability, lightweight nature, and ease of cleaning. It is marketed as versatile and suitable for various uses, including serving as a center table for coffee or tea, holding snacks, or as decorative furniture in indoor settings. The seller also mentions that the assembly is DIY with instructions provided. Buyers’ Images and Reviews: First Buyer’s Review: This buyer praises the table’s color, design, and functionality, especially appreciating the storage tray and ease of mobility due to the wheels. They found the table easy to assemble and suitable for their living room, expressing high satisfaction. This review aligns well with the seller’s description and promotional images, suggesting that this buyer's expectations were met. Second Buyer’s Review: In contrast, this buyer was disappointed because they expected the table to be made of metal. They found the plastic material to be lighter than anticipated, which raised concerns about stability when holding heavier items. Although they appreciated the design, they were hoping for a \"more solid feel.\" This buyer’s dissatisfaction stems from an expectation that was not set by the seller but rather assumed by the buyer. Comparison and Conclusion: Alignment with Description: The product received by both buyers visually and functionally matches the seller's description. The table’s lightweight plastic construction, wheels, and storage tray align with the advertised features. The seller clearly stated the material (polypropylene plastic), which should have set appropriate expectations regarding weight and sturdiness. Buyer Satisfaction: The first buyer is fully satisfied with the product, finding it aesthetically pleasing, functional, and easy to move. The second buyer, however, is disappointed because they had assumed the table would be metal and more solid. This expectation was not based on the seller’s description, as the material was explicitly mentioned. Final Assessment: The seller accurately described the table’s material, design, and features, which aligns with the product received by the buyers. The dissatisfaction expressed by the second buyer is due to a personal expectation of a metal table, which was not implied or suggested by the seller. Thus, the seller is not at fault, as the product meets the described specifications. The second buyer’s concerns about stability are a subjective opinion based on their own expectation, not a flaw in the product as advertised.",
