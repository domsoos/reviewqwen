    "review": "The included memory card was defective, and the product packaging appeared tampered with. Setup instructions were vague and difficult to follow.",
    "Expected-output": "The seller claimed that the product includes a functional 64GB memory card and clear step-by-step setup instructions. The buyer's review and images highlight a defective memory card, tampered packaging, and unclear instructions, which deviate from the seller's description. These issues contribute to dissatisfaction, with the fault lying with the seller for the quality control and packaging discrepancies.",
