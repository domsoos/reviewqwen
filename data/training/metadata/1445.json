    "review": "I was initially impressed with the design and comfort of these shoes. However, within just four months of moderate use, the material started to tear, as shown in the attached picture. For the price, I expected much better durability. Definitely not suitable for regular use. I would not recommend this product to anyone looking for long-lasting footwear.",
    "expected-output": "The seller describes the NIVIA Men Flash 2.0 Non-Marking Badminton Shoes as high-quality, durable, and comfortable, specifically designed for badminton enthusiasts. Key features include a PVC synthetic leather upper with mesh for breathability, a die-cut soft NR EVA sock liner, and a soft cushion inner insole for comfort. The shoes also feature a non-marking outsole and forepart stitching for toe support, enhancing athletic performance. The product is positioned as a durable choice for regular badminton players. However, the buyer was initially satisfied with the design and comfort but reported that the shoes began tearing within four months of moderate use, leading to disappointment in the quality and a perception that the product does not meet durability expectations, especially for its price. The buyer does not recommend the product, citing its short lifespan. The seller's image highlights a clean and visually appealing product, emphasizing design and features, while the buyer's image shows visible wear and tear, particularly damage to the upper material, indicating poor durability. This discrepancy suggests that the product's actual lifespan does not justify its cost, leading to buyer dissatisfaction. The fault lies primarily with the seller, as the product failed to meet the advertised durability standards. The seller should ensure better quality control to align the product\u2019s actual performance with its marketed promises.",
