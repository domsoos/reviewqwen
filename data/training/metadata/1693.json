    "review": "After paying so much the wood in front (playing area) was cracked.",
    "expected-output": "The buyer's review highlights significant dissatisfaction with the product, specifically mentioning that the wood in the front (the playing area) was cracked, despite the higher price paid for the Cajon. This issue is a clear discrepancy between the buyer's expectations and the actual condition of the product. The seller’s description promises a high-quality Cajon with an oak wood tapa and a solid MDF shell, boasting features such as adjustable snare wires and a range of sounds suitable for live performances or studio use. The buyer’s image aligns with the seller’s product in terms of appearance, but the visible crack in the front suggests a quality control or handling issue that the seller did not address.While the seller’s description highlights the durable construction and high-quality materials, the presence of the crack points to a potential flaw in manufacturing or shipping. Given that the Cajon was received in a damaged state, it seems the fault lies with either the product's quality control or the shipping process, rather than the seller's description or the actual performance of the Cajon.In conclusion, the buyer is dissatisfied due to the cracked wood on the playing area, which compromises the product's appearance and potentially its durability. While the seller's product description accurately describes the features and quality of the Cajon, the damage upon arrival suggests that either manufacturing defects or shipping issues are to blame. The seller may need to review their packaging or quality assurance processes to prevent such issues in the future. The fault here lies more with the condition in which the product was delivered, rather than any inherent flaw in the product itself.",
