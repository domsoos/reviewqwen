    "review": "The power bank\u2019s build quality is disappointing, with the attached strap breaking after minimal use. The waterproof feature also failed during light rain, leaving the device non-functional.",
    "Expected-output": "The buyer\u2019s images reveal a damaged strap and water exposure, contradicting the seller\u2019s claim of a durable, waterproof design. The seller\u2019s product does not align with the described features, resulting in buyer dissatisfaction. Here, the seller is at fault for product shortcomings.",
