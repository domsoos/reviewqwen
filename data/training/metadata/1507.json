    "expected-output": "The seller advertises the dog food as a complete and balanced diet for adult dogs, designed to promote strong muscles, bones, teeth, a shinier coat, and digestive health, with nutritional content including 20% crude protein, 10% crude fat, and 5% crude fiber. It is developed by experts at the Waltham Centre for Pet Nutrition and comes in a convenient bag for easy storage. The buyer’s review praises the on-time delivery and reasonable price compared to other websites but does not address the product’s specific qualities or its alignment with the seller’s claims about health benefits. While the review provides positive feedback on service and pricing, it does not offer insight into the product’s effectiveness. The seller could encourage more detailed reviews about the product’s impact on health while emphasizing affordability as a key selling point.",
