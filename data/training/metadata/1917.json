    "review": "Worst. I got neck pain using it.Not at all comfortableThey have given a thick thread to maintain its curve of the pillow, but I cause discomfort and pain. It feels like resting your neck in a hanging rope.Highly disappointed .",
    "expected-output": "The seller's image and description clearly show a neck pillow designed for comfort and support, emphasizing features such as stress relief, portability, and versatility for use in different environments. The seller also highlights the soft outer fabric and secure fastening mechanism. However, the buyer's review presents a stark contrast, as they express dissatisfaction with the pillow, claiming it caused neck pain and discomfort due to a thick thread used to maintain its curve. The buyer feels that the pillow felt more like a hanging rope rather than providing the promised comfort and support. This indicates a discrepancy between the seller's description of the pillow as a comfort and neck pain relief product and the buyer's negative experience with it. The fault appears to lie with the product's design, particularly the choice of materials or construction that did not meet the buyer's expectations, making the seller accountable for the product's failure to deliver the advertised comfort.",
