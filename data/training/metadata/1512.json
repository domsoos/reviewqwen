    "review": "Damage packet.Products is good. But packing is not good",
    "expected-output": "The seller advertises the dog food as promoting healthy skin, a shiny coat, a strong immune system, digestive health, and joint strength, packaged conveniently for storage and serving. While the buyer is satisfied with the product's quality, they note an issue with the packaging being damaged upon delivery. This feedback suggests that although the product met the buyer's expectations, the damaged packaging detracted slightly from the overall experience. The seller should improve packaging to prevent damage during shipping, ensuring the product consistently arrives in excellent condition. Addressing this feedback through enhanced packaging practices and quality control will help maintain customer satisfaction and trust.",
