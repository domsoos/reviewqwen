    "review": " I purchased the Callaway Supersoft Golf Balls, not for golfing but to use them as learning aids for my kids! Their smooth texture and durable design make them perfect for teaching shapes, patterns, and even numbers when paired with fun activities. The white surface is great for drawing or writing on with markers, making them reusable for different lessons. While I haven\u2019t tried them on a golf course, these balls have turned out to be an amazing educational tool that keeps my kids engaged and entertained. Highly recommend for creative parents!",
