Featuring long-lasting zippers and double-stitched lining, it stays as good as new even after washing. Available in two additional sizes: Queen Size (6.5ft x 5.5ft x 4.5ft) and Single Bed (6.56ft x 3.9ft x 4.2ft) to suit different needs. Comes with a convenient storage bag for portability.",
    "review": "The zippers on the mosquito net broke the second time I used it. This product does not justify the price at all.",
    "Expected-output": "The seller describes 'long-lasting zippers' as a key feature of the product. However, the buyer's review and images show broken zippers, which contradicts the claim of durability. This discrepancy suggests a lack of quality control in the product, resulting in buyer dissatisfaction.",
