    "review": "Case quite solid and attractive colour. Locks and opens quite smoothly. Relatively airtight.However, spots and scratches appeared after only 3 days of use.",
    "expected-output": "The buyer's review highlights some positive aspects of the RFID-blocking card holder, such as its solid build, attractive color, and smooth operation. However, the buyer also mentions that spots and scratches appeared after just three days of use, which is a negative experience regarding the product's durability. The seller's description accurately outlines the product's features, including the RFID-blocking function and its compact design. The discrepancy here lies in the product's durability, as the buyer experienced premature wear and tear, which was not mentioned in the seller's description. While the buyer initially seemed satisfied, the premature damage to the product indicates a potential issue with its quality. Therefore, the fault may lie with the seller's product quality, as it did not meet expectations for durability.",
