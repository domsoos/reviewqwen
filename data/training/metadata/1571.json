However, the buyer reported that the product package was tampered with, indicating damage or mishandling during delivery or storage. While the seller\u2019s claims about the product\u2019s nutritional benefits remain valid, the tampered packaging raises concerns about shipping, handling, or warehouse conditions, impacting customer satisfaction and trust. To address such issues, the seller could improve packaging or shipping methods by using reinforced packaging and partnering with reliable carriers.
