    "review": "I found the mosquito net too small to cover my bed as claimed. The description of size compatibility is misleading, making the net unusable for larger beds.",
    "Expected-output": "The seller's description claims the product is suitable for King-sized beds, as highlighted in the sizing chart. However, the buyer's image demonstrates inadequate coverage, which supports their review of improper sizing. Despite the seller's assurance of compatibility, the product did not meet the expectations described, leading to buyer dissatisfaction.",
