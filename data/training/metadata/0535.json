    "review": "The shoes were very poorly manufactured and came unstitched where the boot meets the sole, at the point of the instep. They were purchased in late December as a Christmas gift, with a return window ending on 1/31/24. They were used twice a week for two months. I made three calls to Amazon. The first representative put me on hold for 24 minutes, so I hung up. The second representative was insistent that I could not return the shoes to Amazon. She said I need to go through the New Balance Store, which has nothing but Amazon links - she could not give me any specific details as to how to deal with New Balance. When I asked for a supervisor, I was told that the supervisor does not accept calls. On my third attempt, Amazon's representative told me that she had good news - The return window would be extended. Then she explained that I would eat 18  as a re-stocking fee. Utter nonsense!. Amazon needs to stand by the products that they sell, or eat the cost of dealing with their own vendors.",
    "expected-output": "Seller Description: The seller highlights the durability and eco-friendliness of these New Balance shoes, with details about the use of recycled materials, ENCAP midsole cushioning for comfort, and a rubber outsole with recycled rubber content. This suggests a product designed for durability and sustainability. Buyer Review: The buyer expresses dissatisfaction due to poor manufacturing quality, with the shoe coming unstitched near the instep after limited use. The buyer further notes the challenges faced in attempting to resolve this issue with Amazon customer service, ultimately resulting in a frustrating experience. The return process is particularly criticized, as Amazon imposed a re-stocking fee despite the product defect. Visual Comparison (Seller vs. Buyer Images): The seller's image shows a new and well-stitched shoe with no visible defects. In contrast, the buyer’s image reveals a significant defect with unstitched areas near the sole, which contradicts the seller’s description of a high-quality, durable product. Conclusion: The buyer is clearly dissatisfied, and the reason is valid, stemming from a genuine defect in the product. The discrepancy appears to lie with the quality control of the product rather than buyer expectations or misuse. This issue is compounded by Amazon's unhelpful return policy and customer service experience, adding to the buyer's frustration. \" The seller is at fault due to a quality control issue, as the shoe became unstitched after limited use, contradicting the advertised durability. The buyer's frustration was further exacerbated by Amazon's re-stocking fee, leading to overall dissatisfaction.",
