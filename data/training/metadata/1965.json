    "review": "Size is small , good cotton quality but holes are big.",
    "expected-output": "The buyer's review indicates mixed satisfaction with the eco-friendly kitchen grocery bags. They appreciated the good cotton quality but noted that the bags' size is small and the holes are too big. This suggests that the bags might not be as suitable for storing certain items, potentially leading to a mismatch with the buyer's expectations. The seller's description highlights the bags' food-safe design, versatility, and durability, but does not mention the specific issue of the holes being too large, which could be a potential discrepancy in product performance. While the cotton quality meets the buyer's expectations, the size and hole size may need improvement. The buyer seems somewhat dissatisfied due to these functional issues, suggesting that the seller might need to improve the design for better utility.",
