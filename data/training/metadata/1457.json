    "expected-output": "The Frido Dual Gel Insoles are advertised as a high-quality solution to improve foot comfort and reduce fatigue. Made from silicone and fabric, they promise excellent cushioning and heel protection, making them suitable for various footwear types like sneakers, shoes, and boots. The insoles are described as lightweight, enhancing the user experience by replacing existing insoles or adding comfort to loose shoes. The buyer expressed dissatisfaction with the product, noting that the insoles are very heavy and difficult to use. They requested a return, mentioning that the product is not useful to them and does not meet their expectations. Seller's Image Displays the product as sleek and lightweight with features highlighted for comfort and ease of use. The visuals imply an ergonomic design with emphasis on dual gel technology. Buyer's Image Shows the actual product, which visually aligns with the seller\u2019s description in terms of design and construction. However, the weight issue raised by the buyer cannot be assessed through the images. While the product's physical appearance aligns with the seller's description, the buyer reported a significant issue with the insoles' weight, contradicting the advertised lightweight nature. This functional aspect may have been misrepresented or poorly communicated. The buyer is dissatisfied due to the product's heaviness, which directly impacts its usability. Although the visual and material quality matches the seller's claims, the core issue lies in the mismatch between the product's actual weight and the buyer's expectations based on the description. The fault may lie with the seller for not adequately clarifying the product's weight in the description.",
