    "review": "After just a week of use, the side seams started coming apart, making the bag unusable for carrying gym essentials.",
    "Expected-output": "The seller assures a robust design with heavy-quality material suitable for gym and travel. However, the buyer's image clearly shows side seams coming apart, indicating a lack of durability. This issue contradicts the seller's claim of rigorous quality checks. The bag's appearance and compartments match the advertised design, but the structural weakness reflects poor manufacturing. The fault is with the seller for not ensuring product longevity.",
