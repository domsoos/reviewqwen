The buyer reports that their kittens eat the food but do not enjoy it as much as Whiskas, suggesting that while the product meets nutritional claims, it may lack palatability for some kittens. To improve, the seller could introduce additional flavors and gather feedback to better cater to varying taste preferences, enhancing the product\u2019s appeal.",
