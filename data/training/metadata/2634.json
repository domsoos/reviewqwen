    "seller_description": "The Control D Nebulizer is designed to provide effective nebulization for the entire family, featuring both adult and child-sized masks for easier inhalation. With a medication capacity of 5 ml and a power requirement of 230 V AC, 50 Hz, and 75 W power consumption, it ensures efficient atomization of medication into fine particles, allowing for more effective delivery to the respiratory tract. It does not work with water; instead, it converts medication into a mist that is inhaled at room temperature through the mask. The nebulizer comes with a 12-month warranty from the date of invoice. It\u2019s important to note that nebulizers convert medicine into mist, while steamers convert water into hot steam, and these two products should not be confused, as they serve different respiratory care purposes.",
    "review": "The packaging design is outdated and does not match my expectations for a modern-looking medical device.",
    "Expected-output": "The buyer expresses dissatisfaction with the product's packaging aesthetics, which is not a feature described or promised in the seller\u2019s description. The functionality of the nebulizer, as stated by the seller, aligns with the buyer images showing the product in proper working condition. This review highlights personal aesthetic preferences rather than any issue with the seller's claims, placing the fault with the buyer\u2019s expectations.",
