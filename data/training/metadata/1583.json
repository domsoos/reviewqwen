    "expected-output": " The seller offers dog food designed to support overall health with a blend of vitamins and organic minerals, aiming to maintain healthy bones, stronger teeth, and vitality, with promises of a balanced diet suitable for dogs of all sizes. The buyer, however, expresses dissatisfaction, describing the product as having bad quality and not containing chicken as advertised. This discrepancy highlights a potential quality issue and mismatch between the product's description and its actual ingredients. To address this, the seller should enhance quality control to ensure the product matches the advertised claims, especially regarding the presence of chicken. Clearer labeling and marketing could prevent misunderstandings, and prompt customer service responses, including refunds or replacements, could help restore customer trust and satisfaction.",
