    "review": "The salt spilled all over my kitchen when the packet tore while opening. Not expected from such a reputed brand!",
    "Expected-output": "The buyer\u2019s review highlights dissatisfaction with the packaging quality. While the seller description emphasizes hygiene, purity, and ease of storage, the buyer images display a torn packet with spilled salt, indicating a packaging issue. The seller\u2019s image shows intact packaging, but the buyer\u2019s experience contradicts this promise of quality. Fault lies with the seller for poor packaging quality.",
