    "review": "Nice shoes but at the back of the top opposite to knee, the joint makes impression on skin on the back of legs. Initially it was a shoe bite and now skin has a pigment mark. Even if I wear socks, stained mark are formed on socks. There is no foam or soft cushion in this area, due to which this part is hard rubbing the skin during walk or run. Better to look for other shoes. Not so comfy for running.",
    "expected-output": "The seller promotes the Sparx Sports Shoes as durable, high-quality, and performance-oriented, emphasizing features like a breathable mesh upper, an EVA sole, and elegant packaging, presenting them as stylish, versatile, and easy to maintain. However, the buyer's experience contrasts sharply, reporting significant discomfort caused by the back part of the shoe, which lacks cushioning and causes skin irritation, shoe bites, pigment marks, and stains on socks due to hard rubbing. The buyer's dissatisfaction is further validated by their images showing wear and the problematic area, exposing a key design flaw not mentioned in the seller's description. This discrepancy undermines the seller's claims of quality and usability, as the lack of cushioning at the back renders the shoes unsuitable for walking or running, leading the buyer to recommend exploring alternative options.",
