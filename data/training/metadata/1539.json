    "expected-output": "The seller advertises Whiskas Dry Cat Food as a premium, balanced meal enriched with essential nutrients, antioxidants, and vitamins for cat health, highlighting its benefits for coat, eyesight, and bones. However, the buyer reports an extreme quality issue, receiving a packet full of worms, indicating serious lapses in storage, handling, or quality control. This experience not only undermines the product's marketed promises but also poses a significant health risk, damaging trust in the brand. Immediate action is required to investigate and rectify the issue, offer refunds or replacements, and ensure better packaging and storage to prevent recurrence.",
