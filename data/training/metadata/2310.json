    "review": "I have used Johnson & Johnson band-aids since I was a kid 50+ years, my mom used them back then and it's the only brand I have ever bought and trusted. Tried others they horrible, never stick correct. I really like these flexible/breathable Band-Aid. They bend with your skin, while they stick to your skin, they still flex and do no pull on your skin like the plastic ones do. I like that the band-aid sticks and stays on, if with your hand or covered location in water or when showering. Really keeps the dirt and bacteria out. I Love this 100 pack cause this is the size I use 75% of the time and if I buy the box with various sizes, this is the size I am always missing, cause I have used them all. Good price also. These come Highly recommended.",
