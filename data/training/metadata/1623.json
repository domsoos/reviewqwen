Based on my experience, I strongly advise against purchasing this wireless microphone. The lack of reliable charging make it a frustrating and unreliable product",
    "expected-output": "The seller describes the wireless microphone as a high-quality product with features such as noise filtering, automatic pairing, fast charging, 360° sound capture, and a long wireless range of up to 100 meters. However, the buyer reports significant issues, specifically with the charging functionality of both transmitters, which began failing after only a few uses. This problem renders the product unreliable and contradicts the seller's promise of a seamless and hassle-free experience. The buyer's dissatisfaction is valid, as the core functionality of the product has been compromised, indicating a fault on the part of the seller, either in quality assurance or product durability.",
