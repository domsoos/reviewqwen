    "seller_description": "This set of heavy-duty plastic vacuum compression storage bags is perfect for saving space and protecting your belongings. Designed to compress bulky textiles, clothing, linens, and more by up to 80%, these bags are an ideal solution for maximizing storage. They safeguard items from moisture, dirt, insects, mold, odors, and other potential damage. Each bag features a heavy-duty valve and a double-seal zipper to ensure airtight protection. The pack includes five large bags (80 x 60 cm) and comes with a convenient hand pump, or you can connect the bags to any standard vacuum cleaner hose for quicker results.",
    "review": "The zippers are poorly designed and do not seal the bags completely, allowing odors and air to seep in.",
    "Expected-output": "The seller description states the zipper provides airtight sealing, but the buyer's image and review show the opposite. The failure of the zippers to seal effectively breaks the promise of airtight protection, leaving the seller at fault for the buyer's dissatisfaction.",
    "label": "-1 buyers opinion"
