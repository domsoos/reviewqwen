    "expected_output": "The seller's image displays a polished electric kettle with a stainless steel body and a black handle, presented in a visually appealing manner designed to attract potential buyers. The description promises an aesthetic and functional product, with features like a 360° swivel base, cordless pouring, BPA-free materials, and quick boiling capabilities. However, the buyer's image reveals a damaged product, with water dripping from beneath the handle as mentioned in the review. The buyer acknowledges the overall quality of the product but expresses dissatisfaction due to the defect. This suggests that the fault lies with the seller, likely due to inadequate quality control during packaging or shipping. The seller has failed to meet the buyer's expectations by delivering a damaged item, which contradicts the promises made in the description. In conclusion, the buyer's dissatisfaction stems from the defect, and the seller is at fault for the oversight.",
