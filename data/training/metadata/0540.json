    "review": "I'm so disappointed. I ordered these in white a while back and they were so comfy so I decided to buy them in black too. When I opened the box I was met with crumbling dirt falling out and as you can see the bottoms of the shoes are covered in dried mud. These are clearly used shoes.",
    "expected-output": "Seller Description: The sandals are described as having a rubber or synthetic sole, leather outer material, and buckle closure. The design emphasizes style, comfort with a breathable lining, and a fashionable wedge platform with a lug sole for a trendy look. Buyer Review: The buyer expresses strong dissatisfaction, noting that the sandals arrived covered in dried mud, indicating they were pre-used rather than new. This condition conflicts sharply with expectations for a new purchase, and the buyer was understandably disappointed. Visual Comparison: The seller\u2019s image shows a pristine, black sandal with a clean lug sole, while the buyer\u2019s image displays the same design but with visible dirt and signs of wear on the soles, reinforcing the buyer's statement that they received a used pair. Conclusion: The buyer is dissatisfied due to the sandals arriving in a used and dirty condition, contradicting the seller's implied promise of a new, high-quality product. The fault here lies with the seller (or possibly the seller\u2019s fulfillment process), as the sandals were misrepresented by not being in new condition upon delivery. This misalignment is a clear product issue, not a matter of buyer opinion.\" The seller is at fault due to a fulfillment or quality control issue, as the sandals arrived in a used and dirty condition, contradicting the seller's implied promise of a new product and resulting in buyer dissatisfaction.",
