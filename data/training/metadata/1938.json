    "review": "It is malfunctioning even after replacing the battery. Refer upload and replace the product urgently as we are going to travel in a week from today 15/10/2022.",
    "expected_output": "The buyer's review indicates dissatisfaction with the product, mentioning that the luggage scale is malfunctioning despite replacing the battery. The buyer requests a product replacement urgently due to upcoming travel. While the seller’s description highlights the product’s features, including its compact design, functionality, and accuracy, the buyer’s experience suggests a defective unit. This issue appears to be a manufacturing or quality control problem, not a misalignment in the seller's description or the product's promised features. In this case, the fault lies with the product's quality, and the seller should address the buyer's request for a replacement promptly.",
