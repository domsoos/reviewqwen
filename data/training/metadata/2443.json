    "review": "These headphones sound great! They block out sound well. I imagine that being on a plane or at the gym that these will work great. Not as well as something that costs 10x more but they still do not disappoint! Very comfortable too. And the 35 hour battery power is also as advertised! I'm going to get another pair\u200b",
