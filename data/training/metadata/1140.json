    "review": "The watch is good but the color is completely different from what was shown, which is disappointing.",
    "expected-output": "The seller describes a stylish watch with a vibrant red PU strap and a black dial, emphasizing its bold and modern aesthetic as a versatile accessory suitable for various occasions, with durability, comfort, and a designer appeal tailored for younger audiences. However, the buyer’s review highlights a significant discrepancy, stating that the color of the watch received is entirely different from what was shown in the description or images. While the buyer acknowledges that the watch itself is “good,” the mismatch in color has led to disappointment, as it undermines the buyer’s expectations based on the seller’s description. This reflects a failure on the part of the seller to deliver a product that aligns with the advertised appearance, which is a key aspect of the purchase decision for an accessory like a watch. Although the functionality of the product is not questioned, the inaccurate representation of its visual attributes directly impacts buyer satisfaction.",
