    "seller_description": "To operate the multimeter with a square wave output of 50Hz and 3Vp-p, first ensure the output jack is labeled V ohm mA and COM for proper connections. For testing the magnification ratio of a transistor, set the switch to the hFE position and insert the transistor into the eight-hole jack. When measuring DC voltage, AC voltage, DC current, resistance, diode, buzzer, or battery, connect the red test lead to the V 0 mA jack and the black test lead to the COM jack. If measuring current above 200mA, switch the red test lead to the OADC jack and the black lead to the COM jack. For temperature measurements, connect the temperature probe to either the V 0 mA or COM jack. Always refer to the attached instruction manual for detailed operating guidelines.",
    "review": "The buzzer sound is very very low and feeble.",
    "expected-output": "The seller's description provides detailed instructions on how to operate the multimeter, including connections and measurements for various functionalities like voltage, current, resistance, and temperature. However, the buyer's review highlights an issue with the buzzer, stating that the sound is very very low and feeble. This points to a potential quality issue with the buzzer function of the multimeter, which is not addressed in the seller's description. While the description does not mention the volume of the buzzer, it would have been reasonable for the seller to include some reference to this feature, especially if the buzzer is a critical part of the device. In this case, the discrepancy lies in the buyer\u2019s dissatisfaction with the buzzer's performance, which suggests the fault may be with the product's quality, specifically the buzzer function. The buyer seems dissatisfied, and it can be concluded that the issue lies with the product itself, rather than with any misrepresentation by the seller.",
