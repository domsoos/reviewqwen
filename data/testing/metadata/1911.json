    "expected_output": "The seller's description for the portable LCD electronic balance digital scale emphasizes a lightweight, portable design with a capacity of 110lb/50kg, an accuracy of 5g or 10g, and an easy-to-read blue backlit LCD screen. However, the buyer's review expresses significant dissatisfaction, stating that the product is of poor quality, broken, and not useful. This discrepancy suggests that either the product received by the buyer was defective or the seller's description may have been overly optimistic in representing its durability and functionality. Based on the review, the fault lies with the seller for providing a substandard product that did not meet the buyer's expectations or match the advertised quality, which ultimately led to the buyer's dissatisfaction.",
