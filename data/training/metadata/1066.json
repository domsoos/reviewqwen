    "expected-output":"The seller description for the dog biscuits highlights the product as being made with real chicken, with added vitamins and minerals, and a crunchy texture to promote dental health. It also mentions that the product is suitable for all breeds and life stages and is packaged in a convenient jar. The provided seller image showcases a properly sealed jar with a visible lid, which aligns with the description. However, the buyer review expresses dissatisfaction due to bad packaging, specifically pointing out that one of the jars was delivered without a lid. The buyer's uploaded image confirms this complaint, as the jar appears incomplete without the promised lid, which impacts the storage convenience claimed by the seller. The buyer does not criticize the quality of the biscuits themselves, indicating satisfaction with the product but dissatisfaction with its packaging. In this case, the fault lies with the seller or their logistics partner, as the delivered product does not fully meet the described and advertised standards due to poor packaging. The seller needs to ensure better quality checks for packaging to avoid such issues in the future.",
