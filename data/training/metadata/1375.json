Buyer's Review Analysis The buyer expresses dissatisfaction with the product: Overpriced:  The buyer feels the product was overpriced at  ₹568 , now available for under ₹300 , indicating that the price does not justify the product's performance or longevity. Short Lifespan: The product worked for only a few days before it became nonfunctional (dead), which highlights a major issue with  product reliability  and  Durability Analysis of the Images Buyer’s Image:  Likely shows the product in use or possibly indicates the failure, demonstrating that it is no longer operational. Seller’s Image:  Depicts the speaker bicycle light, including features like the LED headlight and horn, which are intended to be functional for a long period. The issue of the light becoming dead after only a few days is not visible in the seller’s image. Discrepancies Identified 1.Price vs. Quality: The buyer mentions that the product was overpriced for its performance, especially since it is now available for a much lower price. This suggests a perceived mismatch between the product’s cost and its quality or functionality.2. Short Lifespan: The product only worked for a few days before failing, which is a significant reliability issue. The seller's description implies that the product should be durable and long-lasting, but the buyer's experience contradicts this. Conclusion The buyer is highly dissatisfied with the  Speaker Bicycle Light , particularly due to its short lifespan and perceived overpricing. The product failed shortly after purchase, which indicates potential issues with its  quality control  or  durability . To address these concerns: The seller should improve the product's  quality control  and ensure it has a longer lifespan. A clear return or replacement policy should be provided to address any issues like product failure. The pricing should be revisited to ensure that the product aligns with its perceived value and quality.",
