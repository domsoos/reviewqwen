    "review": "I got this pair of sunglasses for mother's Day. I was in need of a new pair since my son broke my other pair. I wore this pair on a short 2 hour trip to see my parents. Well, the glasses left burn marks on both sides of my nose. The marks began to peel and left raw exposed skin. After about 3 weeks, I still have red marks on my nose. Please do not buy! DO NOT BUY!",
    "expected-output": "Seller's Description Analysis: The seller describes these sunglasses as: Providing UV400 protection, blocking 99.99% of UVA and UVB radiation, to safeguard eyes against sunlight and glare. Made with high-quality plastic frames and metal hinges, intended to be durable and suitable for long-term use. Versatile and appropriate for various outdoor activities, marketed for comfort and daily wear. Buyer's Review Analysis: The buyer experienced significant discomfort and skin irritation: After a short two-hour wear, the sunglasses caused burn-like marks on both sides of their nose, leading to raw, exposed skin that began peeling. The irritation persisted for about three weeks, leaving red marks on their nose. This experience strongly contradicts the seller’s claim of comfort and suitability for prolonged wear, as the sunglasses caused severe skin irritation in a short time. Image Comparison and Discrepancies: Seller's Image: The sunglasses appear stylish, comfortable, and well-crafted, with no indication of potential for skin irritation. Buyer's Image: The image shows the user’s face with red, raw marks on the nose area where the sunglasses rested, supporting the buyer's claim of discomfort and skin damage after wearing the product. Conclusion: The sunglasses fail to meet the buyer's expectations for comfort, causing severe skin irritation and prolonged marks. This significant issue with material compatibility or design contradicts the seller’s implication of all-day comfort and safety. This discrepancy raises concerns about material quality or fit, leading to buyer dissatisfaction and a strong warning against the product. \" The seller is at fault due to issues with the material or design, as the sunglasses caused significant skin irritation, contradicting the advertised comfort and suitability for prolonged wear, resulting in severe buyer dissatisfaction.",
