    "seller_description": "These folding pet stairs make it easy for your dog or cat to climb on and off furniture, into and out of vehicles, and more. They are ideal for small, disabled, injured, or elderly pets. The non-slip pads on each step provide better traction for your pet's paws, and the optional nonskid feet help keep the stairs stable while protecting your floors. The stairs come ready to use with no assembly required. With dimensions of 23.9 x 16.1 x 19.8 inches, they provide a practical solution for pets in need of assistance.",
    "review": "These folding pet stairs are a blend of practicality and compassion. Every detail, from the non-slip pads to the stable design, whispers care and consideration for pets who deserve nothing but the best. It\u2019s a stairway to trust and comfort.",
    "Expected_output": "The seller outlines a product designed for stability, ease of use, and safety, especially for pets in need of assistance. If buyer images validate the design and reviews confirm features like non-slip pads and nonskid feet, the seller\u2019s description is accurate. Dissatisfaction due to unrealistic expectations, such as a desire for a different material or additional features, would reflect on the buyer rather than the seller. If all promised features function as described, the product successfully fulfills its purpose, ensuring satisfaction for both the buyer and their pet.",
