    "review": "Fail watch",
    "expected-output": "The review indicates dissatisfaction, but the lack of specific feedback makes it difficult to determine the exact nature of the issue. If the watch failed to perform as advertised, the seller is at fault for not meeting the product claims. However, if the dissatisfaction stems from subjective expectations not explicitly promised by the seller, the buyerâ€™s review reflects a personal opinion. Given the vague nature of the feedback, the seller bears responsibility for potential misrepresentation or quality issues.",
