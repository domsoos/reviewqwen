    "review": "Despite claiming to fit all standard sockets, the bulb's base was incompatible with my fixture. I had to buy an adapter separately.",
    "Expected-output": "The buyer's review highlights socket incompatibility despite the seller's description of a universally compatible B22 base. The buyer's image shows the bulb alongside an adapter, supporting the claim. The seller's image and description do not specify any restrictions. The fault lies with the seller for unclear or inaccurate product specifications.",
