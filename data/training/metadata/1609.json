    "seller_description": "This capo is crafted from high-quality, lightweight zinc alloy, ensuring durability and a strong, padded spring-action grip for precise tension. It is designed to fit perfectly on electric and acoustic guitars, ukuleles, banjos, bass guitars, folk guitars, and mandolins. The capo is incredibly easy to use, allowing quick fret changes with one hand without disturbing the tuning. The high-quality silicone pad protects your instrument from scratches and fret buzz while maintaining proper pressure for optimal performance. With its steel spring and internal memory, it provides strength, resistance to fatigue, and stays in tune with excellent intonation across all frets.",
    "review": "The product has dents, scratches, and a loose pivot point, which ruined its look, feel, and functionality. The damage did not appear to have occurred during transit. The build includes the metal with the rubber part for the part that presses the string. The weight is normal. It could have been a value-for-money product if it had arrived in good condition.",
    "expected-output": "The seller describes the capo as a high-quality, durable product made from lightweight zinc alloy, featuring a strong spring-action grip, a silicone pad to protect against scratches and fret buzz, and a fatigue-resistant steel spring for optimal performance and ease of use across various stringed instruments. While the seller’s image portrays a pristine and functional product, the buyer’s review highlights significant flaws, including dents, scratches, and a loose pivot point, which compromised its appearance, feel, and functionality. The buyer notes that the damage did not occur during transit, indicating a manufacturing or quality control issue. Despite recognizing the product’s potential as a value-for-money option, the buyer’s dissatisfaction stems from the product’s poor condition upon arrival. The fault lies with the seller for failing to meet the promised standards of durability and quality, suggesting the need for improved quality assurance processes to prevent such issues.",
