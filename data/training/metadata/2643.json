    "review": "The sockets are placed too close to each other, making it hard to use multiple plugs at the same time.",
    "Expected-output": "The seller's images and description detail ample space between sockets for accommodating various plugs. However, the buyer's image suggests a design flaw where the sockets are too close, causing practical issues during use. This discrepancy between the seller's promise and the buyer's experience indicates a product design oversight, making the seller at fault for this dissatisfaction.",
