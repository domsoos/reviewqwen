    "review": "The blade attachment cracked within a week of normal usage, and it wasn't able to grind dry fruits as advertised.",
    "Expected-output": "The seller promises high durability with unbreakable jars and a strong blade for grinding various food items, including dry fruits. The promotional images depict a reliable product designed for tough grinding tasks. In contrast, the buyer's image shows a cracked blade attachment, contradicting the seller's durability claim. This discrepancy highlights a quality control issue, making the seller responsible for the dissatisfaction.",
