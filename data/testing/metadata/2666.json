    "review": "The colors on the figurines seem faded and not as vibrant as they appeared in the seller\u2019s pictures.",
    "Expected-output": "The seller's images depict vibrant and glossy figurines, while the buyer's images show slightly dull colors. This discrepancy suggests a minor quality control issue, but it doesn\u2019t significantly deviate from the description. The seller bears partial responsibility for this inconsistency.",
