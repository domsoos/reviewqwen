    "review": "The handle feels flimsy and not as durable as described. Expected better quality for the price paid.",
    "Expected-output": "The buyer's review criticizes the build quality of the racquet handle, which contradicts the seller's description of using aircraft-grade ABS plastic for exceptional strength and durability. While the images do not clearly depict the durability, the buyer's experience indicates a discrepancy in the promised quality. The seller is at fault for overpromising on the product's material strength.",
