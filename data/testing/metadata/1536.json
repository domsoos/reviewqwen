    "expected-output": "The seller describes the cat litter as 99.95% dust-free, hypoallergenic, and effective for clumping, with a focus on providing a clean, healthy environment for cats. However, the buyer highlights receiving damaged goods for the third consecutive time, despite being a repeat customer. While the product's quality isn't directly questioned, the consistent delivery of damaged items indicates a persistent packaging or shipping issue. This undermines the sellerâ€™s promise of providing a reliable and well-packaged product, leading to buyer frustration and dissatisfaction.",
