    "review": "The item only came with the one head shaver that was on there it didn't have the other two.",
    "expected-output": "The seller provides a detailed description of the PRITECH callus remover, highlighting several key features. According to the description, the product is intended to be a rechargeable, waterproof, and efficient foot care tool, offering various functionalities including fast and safe callus removal with three interchangeable rollers of varying coarseness. These rollers, as described, serve different functions, such as handling tough calluses, dead skin, and providing gentle maintenance. The callus remover claims to be effective in wet and dry conditions and offers two-speed settings for optimal user control. The buyer's experience, as evidenced by the images and review, reflects dissatisfaction with the product due to missing components. Specifically, the review mentions that the item arrived with only one roller head attached, lacking the two additional rollers advertised in the product description. This absence of advertised components may affect the device’s usability as the buyer is limited to a single roller type, rather than the three specified for different purposes. Additionally, the absence of the extra rollers contradicts the seller's promise, which could have led to the buyer's disappointment. The images provided by the buyer show the product in use but lack any visible indication of additional rollers or packaging that would contain these components. This aligns with the buyer's report of incomplete delivery. Conclusion: In this case, the discrepancy lies with the seller, as the product did not meet the expectations set by the description. The buyer's dissatisfaction is understandable, as they were not provided with the complete set of rollers advertised, which are integral to the product’s intended functionality. The absence of these components limits the device's versatility and hinders the buyer’s ability to use it as described. The fault lies with the seller, as they did not provide the complete set of components as advertised. The missing rollers affect the product's intended functionality and versatility, leading to the buyer’s dissatisfaction. The seller’s responsibility includes ensuring that all advertised parts are included in the package, which was not met in this case.",
