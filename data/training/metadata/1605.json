    "expected-output": "The seller's description of the Portronics Dash 7 wireless lavalier microphone emphasizes its advanced features, including 2.4G Transmission technology for stable connectivity, a 360\u00b0 omnidirectional pickup chip, noise reduction technology, and a plug-and-play Type-C receiver compatible with Android phones, iPhones (15 and above), and cameras. The seller also outlines specific instructions for Android users, mentioning OTG power supply or the use of the Open Camera app for optimal performance. The seller's image showcases a professional product that aligns visually with the description. However, the buyer's review highlights a significant issue: the microphone is not universally compatible with mobile devices, leading to frustration and wasted time attempting to resolve functionality problems. This suggests a disconnect between the seller's description, which presents the microphone as highly compatible and easy to use, and the buyer's experience. While the buyer's image confirms that the received product matches the seller's image, the performance and compatibility fail to meet the buyer's expectations. The dissatisfaction stems from unmet promises regarding the product's usability and compatibility, making the fault lie primarily with the seller for not adequately clarifying the device's limitations in the description. This situation underscores the importance of more precise product descriptions to manage user expectations effectively.",
