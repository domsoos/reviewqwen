    "review": "The LED light on the racquet stopped working after just one day of use. Makes it hard to locate mosquitoes in the dark.",
    "Expected-output": "The buyer's issue revolves around the LED light malfunctioning, which is a key feature promoted in the seller's description for spotting mosquitoes in the dark. The seller's images display a properly functioning racquet, but the buyer's experience with the defective light directly contradicts the seller's claims. The complaint is valid, and the fault lies with the seller for either poor quality control or a defective product.",
