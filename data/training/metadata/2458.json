    "review": "The fit is terrible despite the multiple ear tip sizes. They keep falling out even with minimal movement, which makes them useless for daily activities.",
    "Expected-output": "The buyer is dissatisfied because the product's fit does not align with the seller's description of all-day comfort and customizable ear tip sizes. The seller's images and promises of ergonomic design are contradicted by the buyer's experience, suggesting a fault in the product design or quality control on the seller's part.",
