    "Review": "The kayak had a puncture on the first use, and I had to patch it immediately. Not the durable material as claimed.",
    "Expected-output": "The buyer received a product that did not match the seller's durability claims. The images provided by the buyer show patched areas indicating punctures, which contradict the seller's description of 'superior strength and impact resistance.' The fault lies with the seller due to a discrepancy between the promised durability and the delivered product.",
