It features a 360-degree omni pickup pattern, ensuring clear and full audio capture from all directions. The microphone is battery-powered and has a simple switch to toggle between modes: for smartphones, slide the ON/OFF switch to the OFF position, while for DSLR, camcorders, audio recorders, and PCs, slide it to the ON position. For use with action cameras, customers need to purchase a TRRS to TRS Adapter to ensure compatibility. The microphone also features a one-button switch for easy mode selection between camera and smartphone use.",
