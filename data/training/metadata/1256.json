Made with non-toxic ABS plastic and a glossy exterior, its strong and stylish body features smooth, flexible wheels with clear patterns and an independent suspension system to reduce friction and enable seamless movement around the house. This car offers full-function control, allowing forward, reverse, left, and right turns with a stop function for precision. The anti-skid rubber grip on the wheels ensures stability while driving, and LED headlights provide a realistic touch, illuminating as the car moves forward, making it perfect for racing in dimly lit spaces. Powered by a 500mAh battery, it charges fully in approximately 90 minutes and delivers 60 to 120 minutes of playtime. The charging indicator turns red during charging and turns off when fully charged. An ideal gift for birthdays or festivals, this racer car encourages active play, keeping kids away from screens while sparking their imagination and excitement.",

    "expected-output": "The seller’s description highlights the Wembley Racer Car as a high-quality product with features like LED headlights, a strong glossy body, flexible wheels with an independent suspension system, and a Type-C USB charging cable, marketed as ideal for children’s playtime and a perfect gift. However, the buyer's review expresses dissatisfaction, stating that they received a completely different car from the one advertised. The delivered product's design and features did not match the seller's description, resulting in disappointment. This discrepancy undermines the seller’s promise to deliver the advertised product, with the issue stemming not from the product’s functionality or quality but from the failure to provide the correct item.",
