    "review": "First time buying this product and it’s perfect. The manufacturing says it’s been 2 months. 2 years product life, so I’m very happy with that. The size and quantity is just as it says. Great quality, no worms or anything found. Checked it twice. Great packaging by Amazon. Better value for money than I could’ve found in shops, got 2kg at 370ish price. Saved me a long drive too. And most importantly, my dog loves it. Thank you Amazon. ❤️",
