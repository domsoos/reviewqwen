    "seller_description": "To operate the multimeter with a square wave output of 50Hz and 3Vp-p, first ensure the output jack is labeled V ohm mA and COM for proper connections. For testing the magnification ratio of a transistor, set the switch to the hFE position and insert the transistor into the eight-hole jack. When measuring DC voltage, AC voltage, DC current, resistance, diode, buzzer, or battery, connect the red test lead to the V 0 mA jack and the black test lead to the COM jack. If measuring current above 200mA, switch the red test lead to the OADC jack and the black lead to the COM jack. For temperature measurements, connect the temperature probe to either the V 0 mA or COM jack. Always refer to the attached instruction manual for detailed operating guidelines.",
    "review": "I am a Doctor living in a village have some electronic diagnostic appretus which has some faults,after end of warranty no services available so after some training I have to try diagnosing and accordind repair if minor So I save much time my previous multimeter is dead so I am in acute need Again thanks to Amezon to make urgent delivary",
    "expected-output": "The seller's description provides a detailed guide on how to operate the multimeter, covering various functions and measurements such as DC voltage, AC voltage, current, resistance, and temperature, among others. It emphasizes correct connections and the importance of referring to the instruction manual. The buyer's review, however, expresses personal gratitude for receiving the product quickly and describes their usage context as a doctor in a village with a need for a multimeter to repair electronic diagnostic equipment. The buyer seems satisfied with the product's timely delivery but doesn't specifically comment on the performance or quality of the multimeter itself. There's no indication of any discrepancy between the seller's description and the buyer's experience. The buyer is likely satisfied with the service and the product's functionality for their needs, though the review focuses more on the delivery aspect than the product's performance. No fault can be attributed to either party based on the available information.",
