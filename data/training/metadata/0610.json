    "review": "This worked fine for a week but I started noticing it made my battery leak acid everywhere. Not sure if it's because the button pushes on the batteries or what but I swapped out 3 sets and it did this to each set within 2 weeks of use.",
    "expected-output": "The New England Stories milk frother, as described by the seller, is advertised as a versatile and easy-to-use product designed to create creamy foam in seconds. The product description highlights a powerful motor with high-speed rotation, capable of mixing various beverages beyond coffee, such as matcha, protein shakes, and milkshakes. The ergonomic handle, ease of cleaning, and lightweight design are also emphasized as selling points. Additionally, the seller\u2019s promotional image emphasizes a \"Super Power Motor\" with a rotation speed up to 19,000 RPM, which suggests strong performance and reliability. The frother requires two AA batteries, which are not included. However, the buyer\u2019s experience and provided image reveal issues that contradict the seller\u2019s claims. According to the buyer, the frother initially performed well, but soon began causing battery leaks. The buyer replaced the batteries multiple times, only to encounter repeated acid leakage, potentially indicating a problem with the device\u2019s battery compartment design or alignment. The buyer speculates that the button might exert pressure on the batteries, possibly causing the leakage. The image provided by the buyer corroborates this claim, showing clear signs of battery acid residue inside the battery compartment, which may indicate poor battery housing or a design flaw in the frother's internal structure. This discrepancy highlights a serious concern regarding the product\u2019s durability and safety. The repeated battery leakage poses a risk not only to the frother\u2019s functionality but also to user safety, as battery acid can be hazardous. While the seller promotes the frother as a high-performance tool with a powerful motor, the buyer\u2019s review and image suggest that the frother may lack the structural integrity necessary for long-term use. In conclusion, there appears to be a significant gap between the seller\u2019s advertised durability and performance and the buyer's actual experience. The recurring battery issues indicate a potential design flaw, likely impacting the device\u2019s reliability and user satisfaction. This feedback suggests that prospective buyers should approach this product with caution, especially if battery leakage continues to be a reported issue. The fault lies with the seller due to a probable design flaw in the New England Stories milk frother's battery compartment, which led to recurring battery leaks for the buyer. Despite the seller's claims of durability and high performance, the buyer's experience indicates structural issues that compromise the product's safety and functionality, highlighting a significant discrepancy between the advertised and actual performance.",
