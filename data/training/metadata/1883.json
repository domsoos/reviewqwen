Adjustable and flexible, the tape can easily be customized and cut to size with scissors or a blade to fit any shape.",
    "review": "The quality is good, the adhesive however is average. Also apply this after being completely sure, becasuse once applied, if someone try to reapply, the adhesive will not be very good. I had to use seperate glue to use this. However, It gets the job done. I ordered the 1x3.8 5 mtr tape.",
    "expected-output": "The seller's description of the G-CHARGE Foam Seal Tape outlines its various applications, weatherproof, and durable properties, along with a strong adhesive backing. The buyer's review, while appreciating the quality of the tape, points out a key issue: the adhesive is not as strong as expected. The buyer also mentions that once the tape is applied, it is difficult to reposition, requiring additional glue for proper use. While the product appears to meet the general expectations in terms of function, the buyer experienced some difficulty with the adhesive, which deviates from the seller's description of a strong adhesive backing. This discrepancy suggests that the seller\u2019s description may have overstated the adhesive\u2019s effectiveness. However, the buyer acknowledges that the tape still gets the job done indicating a partial satisfaction with the product's overall performance. The issue lies with the adhesive quality, which the buyer found lacking compared to the seller\u2019s description. Therefore, the fault lies with the product\u2019s adhesive quality, which doesn't fully align with the seller's claims.",
