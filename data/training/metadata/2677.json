    "review": "The racquet is not killing mosquitoes instantly as advertised. Despite fully charging, it takes multiple hits to kill one mosquito. Highly disappointed.",
    "Expected-output": "The buyer's review highlights dissatisfaction with the product's primary feature\u2014instant mosquito elimination. The seller's description and images emphasize the 3,500V DC voltage net mesh for instant results, which does not align with the buyer's experience. The buyer's images show a functional racquet, but the complaint pertains to its effectiveness rather than its physical condition.
