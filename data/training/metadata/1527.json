The jacket is made from durable, weather-resistant materials to keep the dog dry and warm and is adjustable to fit large breeds comfortably. The buyer’s review highlights satisfaction with the overall quality of the jacket but expresses disappointment as the product was received torn. This issue was particularly frustrating since the buyer intended for their dog to wear the jacket on their birthday. The buyer did not place a replacement order in time, possibly due to the urgency of the situation. The torn product reflects a quality control issue that the seller must address by ensuring all products are checked thoroughly before shipping. Customer service should proactively reach out to offer replacements or refunds for defective items, even if a request is not made immediately. Additionally, improving packaging could help prevent damage during shipping and ensure products arrive in perfect condition.",
