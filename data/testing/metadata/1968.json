    "review": "Bag is good, shoes and other accessories fit well. But stitches are very poor quality. I just carry a water bottle, shoes, gloves and wrist support but still strap is starting to tear.",
    "expected-output": "The buyer's review expresses dissatisfaction with the stitching quality of the bag, despite appreciating its spaciousness and the functionality of the separate compartments for shoes and accessories. The seller’s description highlights the bag’s durability and practicality, but the buyer's experience contradicts this in terms of the stitching quality, as the strap began to tear despite carrying a relatively light load. This suggests that while the bag meets the functional and capacity expectations set by the seller, the quality of the stitching may not be up to the standard advertised. The issue with the strap seems to be a manufacturing flaw, indicating that the fault lies with the seller's product quality rather than the buyer’s expectations.",
