    "expected-output": "The Portronics Dash 7 wireless lavalier microphone is marketed as a versatile, plug-and-play device compatible with Android phones, iPhones (15 and above), and cameras, featuring advanced 2.4G transmission technology and omnidirectional noise reduction for superior audio quality. While the buyer confirms the product works perfectly with MI devices, they express uncertainty about compatibility with other brands, particularly regarding the Type-C port, reflecting a personal opinion rather than dissatisfaction with the product itself. The seller's claims about functionality and quality align with the buyer's positive experience, but providing a more detailed compatibility guide and customer support could address such uncertainties and enhance user confidence.",
