    "expected-output": "The seller's description of the Boldfit Heavy Resistance Bands emphasizes their durability and versatility, being made from 100% latex and suitable for a wide range of exercises and fitness levels. It highlights their use for muscle training, physical therapy, and mobility improvement, ensuring consistent progress with regular use. However, the buyer's review reveals dissatisfaction due to receiving a broken band, which directly contradicts the seller's claim of high-quality, durable construction. This discrepancy points to a fault on the seller's part, as the product delivered did not meet the promised standards. The buyer's dissatisfaction is valid, as the broken band renders the product ineffective for its intended purpose.",
