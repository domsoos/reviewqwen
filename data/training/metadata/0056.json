    "review": "I recently bought this for my cat. It's a great grooming tool for him, and he loves the gentle vibrations. I haven't used it for my own beard, but it works wonderfully for trimming my cats fur. Not ideal for people, but fantastic for pet grooming!",
    "expected-output": "Seller\u2019s Description vs. Buyer\u2019s Review: The seller markets the Norelco Shaver 2400 as a powerful and comfortable shaving tool designed for facial hair, with features like ComfortCut blades, 4D Flex Heads, and a pop-up trimmer for precise grooming. The product is aimed at providing a smooth shave with minimal skin irritation, supported by a comfortable ergonomic design and the ability to use it corded or cordless. Additionally, the product is promoted as easy to clean with a pop-up head feature. The buyer, however, does not use the product as intended. Instead of using the shaver for facial grooming, the buyer uses it for trimming their cat\u2019s fur, which is entirely unrelated to the seller\u2019s intended use for the product. The review does not mention how well the shaver performs for its advertised purpose of beard, sideburn, or mustache grooming. Instead, it focuses on an unrelated use case, which makes the review unhelpful for customers who are looking for information about its performance on facial hair. Discrepancy: The buyer\u2019s review is entirely disconnected from the seller\u2019s description. The shaver is marketed as a grooming tool for people, but the review discusses using it for pet grooming. This is a significant departure from the product\u2019s intended use, making it difficult for potential buyers to assess the shaver\u2019s performance for its primary purpose. Conclusion: The buyer\u2019s review does not provide useful feedback on the product\u2019s performance for human use, specifically facial grooming. The review focuses on an unrelated application, making it irrelevant for those seeking a shaver for beards, mustaches, or sideburns. There is no feedback on critical aspects such as the effectiveness of the ComfortCut blades, the smoothness of the shave, or the functionality of the 4D Flex Heads. The fault lies with the buyer in this case. The review fails to address the product\u2019s intended functionality and instead focuses on a pet grooming use. This misalignment makes the review unhelpful for customers who are considering the product for its marketed purpose.\"",
