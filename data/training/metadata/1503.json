    "expected-output": "The seller advertises these dog treats as high-quality, made with real chicken to promote oral health and enriched with Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids for a lustrous coat. The product is described as free from artificial colors and flavors, fortified with essential vitamins and minerals, and suitable for all breeds and life stages. It comes in a conveniently packaged jar to ensure ease of storage.The buyer’s review reflects partial satisfaction, stating that their pup enjoys the biscuits, but both containers arrived tampered. As a result, the buyer had to transfer the biscuits to another container for proper storage. This discrepancy highlights an issue with the packaging quality or the delivery process, as the tampered containers compromise the product’s advertised convenience and safety.The fault lies with the seller for not ensuring secure and tamper-proof packaging that aligns with the product's description. While the biscuits themselves meet the buyer's expectations in terms of quality and taste, the compromised packaging undermines the overall user experience and raises concerns about product safety.",
