Key ingredients like Omega 6 and Zinc promote a healthy coat, Vitamin A and Taurine aid healthy eyesight, and Calcium, Phosphorus, and Vitamin D ensure strong teeth and bones. The buyer mentions that their cats enjoyed the mixed flavor concept, especially the pockets, but liked the green kibble very little. However, they faced an issue with damaged packaging, which had two large holes causing the cream in the pockets to dry out, raising hygiene concerns. Despite this, the buyer considers the product good overall and uses it regularly, indicating satisfaction with its nutritional quality. Recommendations for the seller include improving packaging durability to prevent damage and preserve the product's quality, addressing the green kibble's appeal by offering more flavor options, and engaging with customers to resolve complaints and foster loyalty.",
