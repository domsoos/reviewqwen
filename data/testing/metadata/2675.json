    "review": "The product claims to be vacuum-sealed and hygienic, but the packet I received was punctured, and the salt had clumps.",
    "Expected-output": "The buyer\u2019s review and images show a punctured packet and clumped salt, which directly contradicts the seller\u2019s description of vacuum-sealed and hygienic packaging. The seller\u2019s image displays intact and professional packaging, but the buyer's experience exposes a quality assurance issue. Fault lies with the seller for inadequate packaging quality.",
