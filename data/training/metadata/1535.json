    "review": "Nice product but supplied 570gms less Qty than my ordered Qty of 10kgs. Request for necessary needful action.",
    "expected-output": "The seller describes the cat litter as 99.95% dust-free, hypoallergenic, and effective at clumping, with medium-grain clay for efficient moisture absorption, promising a clean and healthy environment for cats. The buyer finds the product nice and is generally satisfied with its quality but reports receiving 570g less than the 10kg quantity ordered. This discrepancy highlights an issue with order fulfillment rather than product performance. While the product meets expectations in terms of functionality, the seller failed to deliver the correct quantity, leading to buyer dissatisfaction.",
