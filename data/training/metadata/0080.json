    "review": "This is the first review I have ever submitted on Amazon but this is the worst wine opener I have ever used! CORK SCREW DOES NOT GO DOWN CENTER OF CORK, IT JUST CHEWS UP THE SIDE! I have had other brands over the years but this one had a lot of good reviews so I thought I would try it. Not every time, but most of the time the cork screw goes off to the side and just chews the cork up and doesn't go down far enough to even pull cork out. Leaves a mess that falls into the wine bottle. Make another choice",
    "expected-output": "Seller’s Description and Image Review: The seller describes the Secura Electric Wine Bottle Opener as a sleek, stainless steel product with a 4,000-volt grid, rechargeable design, and easy-to-use one-button functionality. The opener is marketed as highly effective in removing corks and compatible with various wine bottle sizes, with the ability to open up to 30 bottles on a single charge. The product is promoted as both compact and efficient, ideal for home use or as a gift. The seller’s images showcase the design, with the blue LED light feature highlighted as an attractive and useful addition. Buyer’s Review and Image Analysis: The buyer’s review is largely negative, expressing frustration with the performance of the corkscrew. Despite the attractive design and potential functionality, the corkscrew mechanism fails to operate as advertised. The buyer reports that the corkscrew often veers off-center, damaging the cork and making it difficult to remove it completely. This failure compromises the product’s primary function and leads to a messy experience, leaving cork particles in the wine bottle. The buyer's frustration is compounded by the repeated failures of the corkscrew to work as intended, undermining the value of the product. Conclusion: The buyer’s experience highlights a critical flaw in the Secura Electric Wine Bottle Opener, particularly with the corkscrew mechanism. While the product’s design and aesthetic appeal align with the seller’s description, its functionality is inconsistent, leading to an unsatisfactory user experience. The issues with the corkscrew not aligning properly and damaging the cork directly contradict the seller’s promise of easy and efficient cork removal. The buyer’s dissatisfaction is valid, and this product appears to suffer from a design or manufacturing defect that prevents it from delivering the performance promised in the description. Fault: The fault lies with the seller in this case. The buyer’s complaint revolves around the corkscrew’s failure to operate correctly, causing significant issues with the product’s functionality. The design or quality control issues related to the corkscrew mechanism have led to a poor user experience, indicating that the product does not meet the seller’s claims. Therefore, the seller is at fault for not delivering a product that performs as promised.",
