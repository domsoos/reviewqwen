    "review": "I want another meter. There is a problem with the meter. It is not making any sound. Please give me another one or else return my money. The one you have given is useless.",
    "expected-output": "The seller's description highlights the digital multimeter\u2019s various functions, including measurements for DC current, AC/DC voltage, resistance, diode, and continuity, along with a large backlit LCD screen, data hold function, and safety features. However, the buyer's review expresses dissatisfaction, stating that the meter is not producing any sound and requesting a replacement or refund. Since the seller did not mention any sound-related functionality in the description, it is likely that the buyer expected a feature not advertised or received a defective unit. Therefore, the fault seems to lie with the product received by the buyer, and the buyer is justified in requesting a replacement or refund.",
