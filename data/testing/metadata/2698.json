    "seller_description": "This semi-automatic top-loading washer comes ready to use with no installation or demo required, and all features are detailed in the included user manual. Equipped with a powerful 270 W motor and hydrologic pulsator, it generates a strong water flow for efficient cleaning. With a 6.5 kg capacity, it is ideal for families of 3 to 4 members. The washer offers two wash programs and comes with a 1-year comprehensive warranty and an additional 6-year warranty on the motor, ensuring durability and reliability.",
    "review": "The size is way too small to be used for a family of four. It seems more suited for single-person use.",
    "Expected-output": "The buyer's review claims the washer is too small for a family, which contradicts the seller's description of it being ideal for families of 3 to 4 members. The images provided by the seller show the dimensions (89 cm x 49 cm x 46 cm), which match the product shown in the buyer's image. This suggests the product meets the specifications. The dissatisfaction seems to stem from the buyer's expectations rather than the seller's fault.",
