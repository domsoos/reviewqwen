    "review": "No Amazon basics product is worth the money you spend. This cat litter was like sand grains. Very small particles and mostly dust. The cat urine will spread more and the litter will end up finishing quicker. And the dust of the litter hurts the cat. A big No to Amazon Basics.",
    "expected-output": "The seller advertises the cat litter as eco-friendly, made from white bentonite clay with a dust-free formulation, a lavender scent for odor control, and a paw-friendly texture, claiming optimal clumping and moisture absorption for a healthy and clean environment. However, the buyer\u2019s review strongly disagrees with these claims, highlighting excessive dust that they describe as harmful to the cat\u2019s health, a sand-like texture with small particles that reduce clumping efficiency, and faster depletion of the litter, making it less cost-effective. The buyer also notes that cat urine spreads easily, contradicting the product\u2019s advertised performance. To address these concerns, the seller should improve the formulation to control dust, consider larger granules for better clumping and absorption, and engage with the dissatisfied customer to resolve their concerns through a refund or replacement while using this feedback to enhance future product iterations.",
