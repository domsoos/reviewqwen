Includes a 140dB horn  with five adjustable sound options, activated by pressing the speaker switch for 5 seconds.

Retractable silicon rubber bel makes installation easy, fitting handlebars with diameters between 0.5 and 1.4 inches. Available in multiple colors and provides a reliable and practical solution for cycling safety. Buyer's Review Analysis The buyer provides mixed feedback: Durability and Battery Life: The  battery life lasts up to 2 hours , which meets expectations, but may be shorter than anticipated for extended use. Clamp Quality:  The rubber clamp  breaks after excessive strain, prompting the buyer to replace it with a metallic clamp, which is deemed more durable. Light Modes: The  three modes  of light (visibility, low visibility, and rapid on-off) are noted, but may not fully meet the buyer's expectations for riding in varying conditions. Horn Sound:The horn sound is not loud enough for city roads, which is a key concern for safety and visibility.Analysis of the Images Buyer\u2019s Image: Likely shows the bicycle light, possibly highlighting the clamp or the light functionality in use. The image may demonstrate how the light is installed or how it performs.Seller\u2019s Image Depicts the bicycle light with the various features, including the light modes and horn, in line with the product description. Discrepancies Identified 1.  Clamp Durability:  The buyer notes that the rubber clamp breaks under strain, which contradicts the seller's description of hassle-free installation. This suggests that the clamp may not be durable enough for prolonged use, especially under high stress 2.Horn Volume: The horn sound is not loud enough for city roads, which is a safety concern. The seller describes the horn as adjustable with five sound options, but the volume may not be sufficient for urban environments.Conclusion The buyer is dissatisfied with certain aspects of the  Speaker Bicycle Light, particularly the durability of the rubber clamp and the insufficient loudness of the horn. The product performs as described in terms of battery life and light modes, but the  rubber clamp  should be improved to avoid breakage under strain, and the  horn's loudness  should be addressed to ensure it is effective on city roads. The seller should consider using more durable materials for the clamp and possibly enhancing the horn's sound for better safety and usability.",
