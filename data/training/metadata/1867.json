    "expected-output": "The seller's description outlines that the product comes as a pack of disposable earplugs with a Noise Reduction Rating (NRR) of 29 decibels and is intended for ear protection and noise reduction. The buyer\u2019s review, however, reveals that they received only 5 earplugs instead of the expected pack of 10. Despite this discrepancy, the buyer chose not to return the product, acknowledging the seller's potential loss but still giving a 4-star rating due to the good quality, softness, and packaging. The fault lies with the seller for not fulfilling the correct quantity, which led to the buyer receiving fewer items than expected.",
