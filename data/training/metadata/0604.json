    "review": "I let the grill preheat for 10 minutes on high. This is more than enough time for an electric grill to get to maximum temperature. It never exceeded 293 degrees, even though it's description clearly states 'up to 450'. While, technically not a lie because 293 does fall into the 'up to 450' range, it's completely a representation of this grills ability. If the grill had a flat surface, it might be good for scrambled eggs and grilled cheese sandwiches. It does not get hot enough for meats to get a proper sear. This is complete garbage. DO NOT BUY. If I saved the box, I would return it in a heartbeat.",
    "expected-output": "The seller, Elite Gourmet, promotes this electric indoor grill as a versatile, high-performance product designed to bring the outdoor grilling experience indoors. The seller’s description emphasizes key features such as the grill’s large 14-inch non-stick surface, a powerful 1300W heating element that can heat up to 450°F, and a circular heating design that promotes even cooking. The grill is advertised as easy to use, with adjustable temperature controls, dishwasher-safe parts for easy cleanup, and a drip tray for collecting fat. The product is marketed as ideal for grilling a variety of foods at once, while the non-stick surface is designed to prevent food from sticking, making cleaning hassle-free. The seller’s images showcase the product in a well-lit, visually appealing setup, displaying a variety of foods cooking on the grill. The thermostat control and the grill’s large cooking surface are clearly visible, reinforcing the product's convenience and versatility. The buyer's experience, however, contrasts significantly with the seller's claims. According to the buyer's review, after preheating the grill for 10 minutes on its highest setting, the grill only reached a maximum temperature of 293°F—far below the advertised 450°F. The buyer’s image, which shows a temperature reading of 293°F next to the grill with a piece of steak on it, supports their claim. The buyer expresses frustration, stating that the grill's temperature is inadequate for cooking meats that require high heat for proper searing. Consequently, the buyer concludes that the grill might be suitable for low-temperature cooking, like making grilled cheese or scrambled eggs, but it does not meet the advertised performance for grilling meats. The buyer further notes that, while the claim of “up to 450°F” technically includes lower temperatures like 293°F, this phrasing feels misleading as it implies a capability that the product does not deliver. Due to this discrepancy, the buyer expresses strong dissatisfaction with the product, describing it as \"complete garbage\" and stating that they would have returned it if they had kept the packaging. In conclusion, the main issue here is a perceived misalignment between the seller’s advertising and the actual performance of the product. The seller’s description suggests a high-temperature capability of up to 450°F, which would be suitable for searing meats and other high-heat cooking tasks. However, the buyer’s experience indicates that the grill falls short of this capability, only reaching 293°F despite preheating adequately. This substantial difference in expected versus actual performance has led to the buyer's frustration and disappointment, as they feel the grill does not meet its advertised claims. The buyer’s concerns appear valid, as the temperature limitation impacts the grill's intended function and does not meet the expectations set by the seller’s description. This situation highlights the importance of accurately representing a product’s performance to align with customer expectations, especially when temperature capabilities are a significant selling point for cooking appliances. The seller is at fault here. The buyer’s dissatisfaction arises from the grill’s inability to reach the advertised temperature of 450°F, instead capping at 293°F, which limits its use for high-heat cooking tasks like searing meat. The substantial gap between the promised and actual performance undermines the product’s advertised versatility and functionality. This misalignment between the product’s capabilities and the seller’s claims justifies the buyer’s frustration, as the grill does not meet the core expectations set by the description.",
