    "review": "Set this up in the guest bathroom, and it's been working exactly as it should. The metallic finish gives it a nice upscale look, and setup was as simple as popping in four AA batteries. Decent soap capacity means you're not constantly refilling it.Quick heads up that might save someone else some trial and error - while it works great with regular liquid soap, it's not designed for foaming soap. Tried it just to see, and yeah, it just dispenses it as liquid. Not a knock against the product, just good to know what it's meant for.The touchless feature works reliably - no awkward waving your hands around trying to trigger it. Perfect for a guest bath where you want something that looks nice but is also practical and hygienic.Something I share in all my reviews - I rate products on a simple idea - what am I getting for my money? That's why this gets 5 stars. Not because it's the fanciest soap dispenser out there, but because it delivers exactly what I needed at a price that makes sense.Bottom line: Solid automatic dispenser if you're using regular liquid soap. Looks good, works consistently, and makes hand washing a bit more convenient for everyone.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b",
