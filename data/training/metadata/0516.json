    "review": "Order the size 2 regular. For reference my measurements are 24.5 inches waist and 35 inches hip. The jeans fit perfectly around my waist without needing a belt which is a rare occurrence for me. Besides the sizing, however, the jeans are way over priced and the color is off. As you can see, I ordered the 'regular blue' yet, the actual color that they came as is not as blue as pictured and actually seems like what the 'light blue' option looks like. The material is also not real denim, so there is no vintage look to them at all. The material is like a jegging: super stretchy. Also, the button is really flimsy and seems like it will fall off easily. I returned them because  46 dollars for these is over priced.",
    "expected-output": "Seller’s Image & Description Image Analysis: The seller’s image displays a pair of high-waisted, straight-leg jeans in a rich blue color. The jeans appear structured with a clean, well-defined shape, and they accentuate the waist and hips while maintaining a straight line through the legs. Description: The seller’s description promotes the jeans as being made from a comfortable, soft, and lightweight fabric with a blend that includes cotton, polyester, viscose, and spandex. They are presented as stretchy, with a relaxed fit that is both stylish and suitable for various occasions. The color is described as “light blue wash,” and the jeans are advertised as high-quality, versatile, and flattering. Buyer’s Image & Review Image Analysis: The buyer’s image shows a pair of jeans that appear slightly faded compared to the richer blue of the seller’s image. The fit is high-waisted, as expected, but the color looks more subdued and closer to a \"light blue\" shade than the vibrant blue in the seller’s photo. Review: The buyer expressed dissatisfaction with the product, primarily due to the color difference and quality concerns. They noted that the jeans they received were lighter than advertised and did not match the “regular blue” description they ordered. They also found the material to be more like stretchy jeggings rather than authentic denim, which did not provide the vintage look they desired. Furthermore, the buyer felt the jeans were overpriced for the quality, citing issues with the flimsy button. Discrepancies and Evaluation Color: There is a clear discrepancy in color between the seller's image and what the buyer received. The seller’s image shows a richer blue, while the buyer describes the color as being closer to the “light blue” option, causing dissatisfaction. Material and Quality: The buyer expected a more denim-like, vintage feel but found the material to be stretchy and similar to jeggings. This discrepancy suggests that the fabric description may not fully align with the actual product received, which led to the buyer's disappointment. The flimsy button was also a quality concern that impacted the buyer’s perception of value. Pricing: The buyer felt that $46 was too high for the jeans, given the material and quality issues, further contributing to their decision to return the product. Conclusion The buyer is dissatisfied with the purchase due to discrepancies in color, material, and perceived quality, which they felt did not align with the seller’s description or the price point. This situation can be categorized as “Seller is incorrect, and the buyer is dissatisfied.” The mismatch in color and fabric type was significant enough to lead to a return. \" The seller is at fault due to discrepancies in color, material, and quality, as the jeans did not match the advertised description, resulting in the buyer's dissatisfaction and decision to return the product.",
