    "seller_description": "This durable navy blue nylon travel bag features a hard-shell design with five compartments: one main compartment, two front pockets, and two side pockets, providing ample space for organization. With smooth-rolling wheels, it ensures easy maneuverability during travel. The bag is made from long-lasting nylon fabric, offering extra durability, while the additional side corner guards provide extra protection when the wheels are in use. Although it is water-resistant, it is not fully waterproof, making it a reliable choice for most weather conditions.
