    "review": "Received my item in working order! I've not used the mixer yet, but I plugged it in and ran it and it runs pretty well! Love the little bowl that snaps on to the mixer that came with the product, its really a useful and helpful touch! Idk about you, but I hate storing mixers and stuff bc the pieces never stay together or I store them in different places. I paid for this with my own money, no I'm not affiliated with Hamilton Beach or Amazon at all, I just really love the storage method on this thing. I'll be donating my other mixer bc this one even takes up less space and the cord stays stored!",
