    "review": "I bought this motorcycle helmet for my winter ride\u2019s because I ride me e-bikes all year round for transportation and the temperature\u2019s can drop below 20 degrees so I needed a helmet to help not only keep me safe but also warm in the winter months and the helmet does just that the neck scarf definitely helps keep the cold air out and is removable for the warmer months witch is a plus for those of you that ride motorcycles in the summer. The visor\u2019s it comes with can be a little tricky to swap as far as putting them on the helmet but not a big issue the only downside is they fog up quickly but that can be solved by putting anti fog film or anti fog spray on the visors but other than that it a great helmet I definitely recommend buying it",
    "Expected_output": "The seller's description of the ILM Motorcycle Helmet highlights its focus on safety, style, and functionality, catering to a wide range of riders. It emphasizes the durable ABS shell, EPS padding, and lightweight design, which together exceed FMVSS-218 and DOT safety standards. Additional features like the aerodynamic design to reduce wind drag, quick-release strap, dual visors (clear and smoked), and a removable neck scarf are positioned as versatile solutions for year-round riding. The helmet also promises user convenience with washable inner lining and available replacements for any unsatisfactory parts. From the buyer\u2019s perspective, the images align with the seller's claims regarding the helmet's robust build and included accessories. The buyer confirms the helmet\u2019s effectiveness in cold weather, noting that the neck scarf blocks cold air and is removable for summer use, consistent with the seller's seasonal adaptability promise. However, the buyer mentions that swapping visors can be tricky, and fogging occurs, suggesting potential usability concerns not fully addressed in the description. These issues are minor and manageable with anti-fog solutions, so they do not significantly impact satisfaction. Based on the alignment between the seller\u2019s description, images, and the buyer\u2019s review, the helmet meets expectations overall, offering the promised value. There is no fault attributable to either party; the buyer expresses general satisfaction with their purchase.",
