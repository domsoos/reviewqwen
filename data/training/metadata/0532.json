    "expected-output": "Seller Description: The seller describes the sunglasses as a stylish aviator design made with durable plastic material, available in various colors, and featuring UV400 lenses for sun protection. The sunglasses are marketed as suitable for outdoor activities, with comfortable nose cushions and high-quality hinges for a firm hold. They\u2019re presented as high-fashion, durable, and versatile. Seller Images: The product images showcase the sunglasses in a sturdy-looking frame with a gradient lens. The images highlight the sunglasses' structure, the nose pad design, and hinge detail, emphasizing the quality and durability. Buyer Review: The buyer is disappointed, stating that the glasses broke within 20 minutes of wear, simply upon removal from their face. The buyer implies that the product's quality does not match the expectations set by the seller, suggesting fragility rather than durability. Buyer Image: The buyer\u2019s image shows the broken sunglasses, with one arm detached from the frame. The break appears to be at the hinge, which is supposed to be reinforced according to the seller. Conclusion: The buyer is dissatisfied due to the product breaking almost immediately after use, contrary to the seller\u2019s claim of durability and quality hinges. The fault lies with the product's actual build quality, as the product failed to meet the advertised sturdiness. This discrepancy between the seller\u2019s promises and the buyer\u2019s experience has led to buyer dissatisfaction.\" The seller is at fault due to a discrepancy between the advertised durability and actual build quality, as the sunglasses broke shortly after initial use, contrary to claims of sturdy construction and reinforced hinges, leading to buyer dissatisfaction.",
