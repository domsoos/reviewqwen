    "expected-output": "The seller's description advertises the Boldfit Hand Gripper as an adjustable resistance tool with a range of 10-60 kg, emphasizing features like durable stainless steel springs, a non-slip ergonomic handle, and versatility for fitness enthusiasts and recovery purposes. However, the buyer's review states that the product has an adjustable range of 5-40 kg, directly contradicting the advertised specifications, though the buyer is satisfied with its build quality and performance, even recommending it. This resistance range discrepancy highlights a misrepresentation in the seller's claims, which could lead to dissatisfaction for buyers seeking the higher advertised range.",
