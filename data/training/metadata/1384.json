The color codes and resistance levels of the tubes sent were not the same as described. Mismatch in Color and Resistance: The buyer compares the original product they had purchased before with the current one. The red, black, green, blue, and yellow tubes in the original product were supposed to correspond to 50 LB, 40 LB, 30 LB, 20 LB, and 10 LB, totaling 68 kg. However, the tubes received were of lower resistance (30 LB, 25 LB, 20 LB, 15 LB, and 10 LB), totaling only 45.3 kg. Grips Issue: The grips of the tubes were also noted to be different from the original Slovic product, adding to the buyer’s frustration with the product mismatch. Analysis of the Images Buyer’s Image: Likely shows the tubes received by the buyer, highlighting the mismatch in color and resistance levels compared to the original product, supporting the buyer’s claims. Seller’s Image: Depicts the product as described, with color and resistance labels that do not match what the buyer received. Discrepancies Identified Product Mismatch: The color and resistance of the tubes sent to the buyer do not match the picture or description on the seller’s listing. The resistance values are significantly lower than what was promised (45.3 kg instead of 68 kg). Grips Issue: The grips of the tubes were also different from the original Slovic product, which adds to the confusion and dissatisfaction. Seller's Handling or Quality Control Issue: The buyer's experience suggests that there may be a problem with the seller's inventory or quality control, resulting in the incorrect items being shipped. Conclusion The buyer is extremely dissatisfied with the Slovic Resistance Tubes, as the wrong items were sent, with mismatched color codes and resistance levels compared to the seller’s description and the buyer’s previous purchases. The grips were also different from the original product, further adding to the disappointment. The seller should investigate the inventory or shipping procedures to ensure that products match the advertised specifications and offer the buyer a replacement or refund for the incorrect items.",
