The buyer is dissatisfied with both the product quality and the return process, which adds to their frustration. Analysis of the Images Buyer’s Image: The buyer's image is unclear regarding specific details of the slippers' quality or damage, as the image does not show any particular flaws or issues. Seller’s Image: The seller's image shows a well-presented product with good design features, but the image does not address the quality concerns raised by the buyer. Discrepancies Identified Product quality: The buyer finds the quality to be poor, which contradicts the seller's description of the slippers as high-quality, skin-friendly, and durable.
