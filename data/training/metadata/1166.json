    "expected-output": "The seller's description emphasizes the sophistication and style of the digital watch, highlighting its rose gold stainless steel band, durable acrylic dial glass, and lightweight resin case. The watch is described as elegant and practical, with water resistance up to 50 meters and accurate quartz movement, appealing to buyers seeking both aesthetics and functionality. The description portrays the watch as a premium product suitable for daily use with a fashionable rose gold finish.The buyer's review starkly contrasts the seller's claims, stating that the product feels lightweight, cheap, dull in color, and does not resemble the advertised rose gold aesthetic. The buyer expresses dissatisfaction with the overall quality and value, labeling the purchase as not worth the money. This suggests a significant discrepancy between the seller's portrayal and the buyer's experience of the product's material and visual appeal.The visual alignment reveals that the product delivered lacks the vibrant rose gold finish advertised in the seller's image, appearing duller and less premium. This discrepancy indicates that the seller's description and images may have set unrealistic expectations. The fault lies with the seller for misrepresenting the product's appearance and quality, leading to buyer dissatisfaction.",
