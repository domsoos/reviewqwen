    "expected_output": "The seller's description highlights the scratch-resistant and impact-resistant polypropylene construction of the trolley bag, emphasizing its durability, stylish design, and utility for both domestic and international travel. It also mentions features like a 360-degree wheeling system for easy maneuverability, an integrated anti-theft combination lock for security, and a luxurious interior lining for added sophistication. The product is offered as a set of three suitcases with a 3-year international warranty against manufacturing defects. The seller's images depict a premium-looking, robust bag set consistent with the described features. The buyer's image shows a bag that largely matches the seller's visuals in terms of design and material. However, the buyer's review states dissatisfaction due to receiving one bag with a damaged zipper and cover, which detracts from the promised quality. While the warranty covers manufacturing defects, the presence of visible damage raises concerns about quality control. This issue indicates that the seller is at fault for not ensuring the product's condition before dispatch, leading to a negative experience for the buyer despite the overall appeal of the product.",
