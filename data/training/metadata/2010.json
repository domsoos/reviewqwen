    "review": "I bought the La Roche-Posay Purifying Foaming Cleanser to use as a gentle cleaner for my car\u2019s dashboard, and I was pleasantly surprised by the results! I diluted a small amount of the cleanser in water, and it effectively removed dust and smudges without leaving streaks or any greasy residue.
