    "review": "I received dumbbells of mismatched weights\u2014one is 5kg as described, but the other is only 3kg. This inconsistency is unacceptable.",
    "Expected-output": "The seller's description and images clearly state that the set includes two 5kg dumbbells, ensuring consistency in weight and quality. However, the buyer's review highlights a mismatch in the weights received, which contradicts the seller's promises. The buyer's images further confirm the inconsistency. Here, the seller is at fault for not ensuring that the correct product was delivered.",
