    "expected-output": "The BOYA BY-M1 microphone is marketed as an omni-directional device compatible with various electronics, including smartphones, DSLR cameras, camcorders, and PCs, featuring 360-degree sound capture, a one-button switch for toggling between smartphone and camera modes, and requiring a TRRS to TRS adapter for action cameras. However, a buyer expressed dissatisfaction, labeling the product as a fake BOYA product, highlighting the absence of a jack and poor overall quality, rendering the microphone unsatisfactory. The seller's image displays the microphone with professional packaging, aligning with the premium description, while the buyer's image suggests discrepancies in the product's authenticity and packaging, raising doubts about quality. Discrepancies identified include the product being labeled as fake, contradicting the seller's claims of a premium microphone, a missing jack indicating a physical defect or incomplete product delivery, and packaging in the buyer’s image not matching the professional-grade depiction in the seller’s materials. In conclusion, the buyer's dissatisfaction is justified due to the product's failure to meet advertised standards, with the seller at fault for delivering a potentially counterfeit and incomplete product, undermining the trust established by their description and promotional images.",
