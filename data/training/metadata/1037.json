    "review": "I got these order today,but pumping pin was missed,how can I pump air to football?",
    "expected-output": "The seller describes the football as a durable and versatile product suitable for various playing surfaces, including hard ground, wet grass, and artificial turf. It is equipped with a butyl bladder to ensure long-lasting air retention and shape consistency, making it ideal for training and recreational use. The seller's image showcases a high-quality football with a modern, visually appealing design that aligns with the description. However, the buyer's review highlights dissatisfaction due to the missing pumping pin, a critical component for inflating the ball, which renders the product unusable upon delivery. The buyer's image supports this claim, focusing on the pump mechanism and underscoring the issue.This discrepancy reflects a shortcoming in quality control and packaging on the seller's part, as the omission of a necessary accessory directly impacts the usability of the product. While the football itself appears to match the seller's visual description, the absence of the pumping pin creates a significant functional gap that contradicts the seller's implicit promise of delivering a ready-to-use product. The buyer's dissatisfaction is justified, and the fault lies with the seller or manufacturer for failing to ensure all necessary components were included in the package. To address such issues, the seller should implement stricter packaging checks to ensure all accessories are provided, thereby preventing similar incidents and ensuring customer satisfaction.",
