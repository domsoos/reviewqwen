    "expected-output": "The seller promotes the shoes as lightweight, breathable, and durable, featuring shockproof construction, air-cushioned outsoles, and non-slip properties for comfort and reduced heel strain during long-term wear. However, the buyer expresses dissatisfaction due to receiving a different color than expected, damaged packaging, and shoes of perceived low and average quality. The buyer's images likely confirm discrepancies, such as a mismatch in color and evidence of damaged packaging, which validate the complaints. These issues highlight failures in the seller's fulfillment and packaging processes, as well as possible misrepresentation of product quality. The seller needs to improve order accuracy, ensure better packaging, and maintain quality consistency to align with buyer expectations and avoid such negative experiences.",
