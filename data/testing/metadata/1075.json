    "review": "Its third quality Item & its pump not working After unboxing",
    "expected-output": "The seller promotes the Beardo Whisky Smoke Eau de Parfum as a luxurious, bold, and sophisticated masculine fragrance with a spicy, woody profile derived from whiskey, oud wood, tobacco, cinnamon, and vanilla. Marketed as a long-lasting perfume with intense base notes like sandalwood and patchouli, it claims to ensure a lasting impression suitable for any occasion. The seller\u2019s images present a well-designed amber bottle with a pump spray, matching the product description. However, the buyer\u2019s review states dissatisfaction, citing a malfunctioning pump immediately upon unboxing and describing the product as third quality, implying poor construction or substandard quality. The buyer\u2019s image confirms the physical resemblance to the seller's product but highlights a non-functional pump, directly conflicting with the seller\u2019s emphasis on quality and luxury. This discrepancy indicates the seller is at fault for either inadequate quality control or delivering a defective product. The buyer\u2019s dissatisfaction is valid as the product failed to meet basic functional expectations upon delivery.",
