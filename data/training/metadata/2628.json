    "review": "The packaging was damaged and dirty upon arrival, which was disappointing.",
    "Expected-output": "The seller's images show neatly packaged microfiber cloths, but the buyer's image reveals a dirty and damaged package. While the seller's product quality might not be affected, the poor packaging does not align with the professional standards depicted in the seller's description and images. This indicates the seller is at fault for not ensuring proper packaging.",
