    "review": "I expected the astronaut to move around the room projecting stars, but it\u2019s stationary and projects only from one spot.",
    "Expected-output": "The seller's description emphasizes the projector's 360-degree rotating head for adjusting light directions and does not claim mobility of the astronaut itself. The buyer\u2019s misunderstanding regarding the mobility of the product is evident and highlights an unrealistic expectation not aligned with the product's capabilities as described by the seller.",
