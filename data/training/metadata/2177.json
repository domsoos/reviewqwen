    "Expected_output": "The seller emphasizes features like a filtered lid to prevent litter scatter, high sides for odor control and spraying containment, and a durable, BPA-free plastic construction. If the buyer\u2019s images show a well-constructed litter box matching the seller's description and reviews confirm the effectiveness of the design (e.g., reduced litter scatter and easy cleaning), the product aligns with its promises. Any dissatisfaction due to size or material preferences not explicitly mentioned in the description would reflect the buyer\u2019s expectations rather than a fault with the seller\u2019s product. If all advertised features perform as described, the seller delivers on their commitment, ensuring satisfaction.",
