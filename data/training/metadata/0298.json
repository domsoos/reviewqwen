    "expected-output": "In this case, the buyer purchased the SBF Furniture shelf unit crafted from engineered wood, featuring seven shelves for ample storage and described as durable, waterproof, and rust-proof. The seller’s description highlights its quality, durability, and suitability for various indoor spaces. The product images provided by the seller show a neatly assembled shelf unit with books displayed in a visually pleasing manner, which aligns with the antique, functional design promoted in the product description. However, the buyer’s experience, as expressed in the review, indicates significant dissatisfaction with the product. The buyer states that the product is difficult to assemble, with parts that do not align correctly for screw placement. The buyer mentions the risk of breaking parts if force is applied to align them, indicating potential quality control issues or design flaws that complicate assembly. The buyer’s frustration is compounded by the unavailability of return or exchange options, despite an initial indication that the product could be returned by a specific date. The buyer’s review reflects disappointment and a perception of the product as a “stupid product,” showing dissatisfaction with both the product and the customer service experience. In analyzing all elements—seller description, seller images, buyer images, and buyer review—there are clear discrepancies between the seller’s promises of ease of use and durability and the buyer’s actual experience with the product’s assembly challenges. The quality concerns raised by the buyer suggest a fault on the seller’s end, possibly due to manufacturing or design issues that hinder easy assembly. The buyer’s dissatisfaction primarily stems from the product’s assembly difficulties, which contradict the advertised convenience and durability. In conclusion, the fault lies with the seller, as the buyer’s grievances are due to product design and assembly issues, not personal preference or expectations misaligned with the description. The product did not meet the advertised standards of quality and usability, resulting in a negative experience for the buyer.",
