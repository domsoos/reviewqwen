    "Review": "The skeg fell off while paddling, making it very difficult to maintain stability. Definitely not as reliable as advertised.",
    "Expected-output": "The buyer experienced instability due to the skeg detaching during use, as shown in their images. This contradicts the seller's claims of 'excellent directional stability with a removable skeg.' The fault lies with the seller, as the advertised quality of the skeg does not align with the buyer's experience.",
