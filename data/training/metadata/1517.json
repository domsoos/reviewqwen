    "review": "It's dusty and not effectively, size of beans are small",
    "expected-output": "The seller advertises the cat litter as eco-friendly, made from white bentonite clay with a dust-free formulation, lavender scent for odor control, rapid moisture absorption, and paw-friendly granules for comfort. While the buyer appreciates the product’s affordability, clumping efficiency, and odor control, they express dissatisfaction with its dustiness, which contradicts the dust-free claim, and the small granule size, which may affect usability and comfort. These concerns highlight a gap between the product’s performance and the seller’s promises. To address this, the seller should improve the formulation to reduce dust, consider offering varied granule sizes, and engage with the buyer to resolve their concerns, potentially enhancing trust and customer satisfaction",
