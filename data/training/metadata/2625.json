    "seller_description": "SOFTSPUN microfiber cloths are ultra-absorbent, lint- and scratch-free, and made from high-quality microfiber (70% polyester, 30% polyamide), offering superior performance and durability. These versatile cloths are ideal for cleaning car exteriors and interiors, bikes, kitchen surfaces, utensils, mirrors, electronic screens, DSLR lenses, and more without using chemicals. Designed with reinforced rounded corners to prevent unraveling, they deliver consistent high quality since 2015. Each pack includes 4 medium-sized cloths (16\u201d x 16\u201d), with additional size and combo options available to suit various cleaning needs. For best results, wash before use, avoid mixing with other fabrics, and refrain from ironing or using chemicals. These premium cloths ensure an efficient, streak-free cleaning experience.",
    "review": "The cloths shed lint after a few washes, making them unusable for cleaning glass surfaces.",
    "Expected-output": "The seller's description highlights these microfiber cloths as lint-free, but the buyer's image shows evident lint on the cloth after washing. The seller's images also emphasize their streak-free cleaning ability, which does not align with the buyer's experience. This discrepancy indicates that the product did not meet the quality standards described by the seller. Here, the seller is at fault for not delivering on the promised lint-free feature.",
