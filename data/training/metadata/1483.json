    "review": "Bekar shoes hai sole gaya mera Waste of money the sole of shoes got removed in 1 week of use applied fewiquick several times it is just showoff shoes with fancy name not at all useful company just making profit by selling worst quality",
    "expected-output": "The seller promotes the shoes as comfortable, breathable, and versatile, with an easy slip-on design, a textured sole for grip, and low-maintenance requirements, positioning them as durable and ideal for everyday wear. However, the buyer reports extreme dissatisfaction, stating that the sole detached after just one week of use despite repair attempts, describing the product as low-quality and a waste of money. While the buyer received the correct product as depicted in the seller's images, their experience contradicts the seller's claims of durability and functionality. This discrepancy highlights a significant quality issue, with the product failing to meet the promised standards, leading to an unsatisfactory buyer experience and unmet expectations.",
