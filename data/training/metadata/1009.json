    "review": "Please don’t buy this safari product its waste of money this is my humble request, please don’t buy this product Customer service is worthless",
    "expected_output": "The seller's images present the Safari trolley bag as a robust and visually appealing product, highlighting features such as its scratch-resistant polypropylene shell, 360-degree wheeling system, and anti-theft combination lock. The buyer's image reveals visible damage to the bag, particularly around the wheels and zipper, which conflicts with the seller's description of the product being highly durable and resistant to impacts. The review further elaborates on dissatisfaction, describing the product as a waste of money and criticizing customer service. This indicates a significant gap between the seller's claims and the buyer's experience. The fault appears to lie with the seller, as the product failed to meet the promised durability and quality standards, and the inadequate customer support exacerbated the buyer's frustration. The seller's inability to address these concerns effectively through their customer service further diminishes the credibility of their claims.",
