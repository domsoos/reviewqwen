    "expected-output": "The seller describes the Doctor Extra Soft flip-flops as exceptionally comfortable, featuring ultra-soft, padded EVA footbeds designed to alleviate foot pain, reduce pressure, and minimize fatigue. They are advertised as lightweight, flexible, and equipped with acupressure points to stimulate reflexology zones, improve circulation, and boost foot health. The product is also marketed as skin-friendly, washable, and suitable for all seasons, promising a smooth and comfortable wearing experience.However, the buyer’s review contradicts this description, stating that the flip-flops are hard and uncomfortable to wear, despite the seller's claims of softness and smoothness. This discrepancy indicates that the product does not deliver on its advertised features, particularly in terms of comfort and material softness. The buyer’s dissatisfaction is valid, as the primary selling point of the flip-flops—exceptional comfort—was not met.The fault lies with the seller for not ensuring that the product meets the advertised standards of comfort and quality. This mismatch between expectations set by the seller and the buyer’s experience highlights a need for better quality control and accurate representation of product features.",
