    "review": "The battery life is far from what was advertised, lasting only 15 miles on pure electric mode instead of the claimed 25 miles.",
    "Expected-output": "The buyer is dissatisfied due to the shorter battery range, which contradicts the seller's description of 25 miles on pure electric mode. This discrepancy highlights a significant issue with the seller's claims. The seller is at fault for providing inaccurate information about the battery range.",
