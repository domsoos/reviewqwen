    "expected-output": "Seller\u2019s Image & Description Image Analysis: The seller\u2019s image shows a pair of high-waisted, straight-leg jeans in a beige color. The jeans appear clean, structured, and new, with a streamlined design intended to flatter the wearer. Description: The seller describes the jeans as having excellent workmanship, no odor, and being soft and lightweight. They emphasize that the jeans are relaxed and comfortable, with a stretchy fabric blend for versatility. The jeans are marketed as trendy and suitable for various occasions. Buyer\u2019s Image & Review Image Analysis: The buyer\u2019s image reveals a pair of jeans that appear wrinkled and show signs of previous wear. There are visible stains, and the jeans look significantly different in condition compared to the pristine appearance in the seller\u2019s image. Review: The buyer expresses extreme dissatisfaction, reporting that the jeans arrived stained, with pet hair, nail polish, and even a used pair of underwear inside. These issues indicate a hygiene concern and an item that appears previously worn rather than new. Discrepancies and Evaluation Condition: There is a stark contrast between the seller\u2019s image of a clean, new product and the buyer\u2019s report of receiving an unclean, used item. This discrepancy suggests a serious quality control or handling issue on the seller\u2019s end. Quality and Cleanliness: The seller\u2019s description promises a high-quality item with \u201cno odor\u201d and excellent workmanship. However, the buyer received a product that was not only dirty but also contained personal items, which goes against any expectation of a new purchase. Conclusion The buyer is highly dissatisfied due to receiving an item in unsanitary and used condition, which does not match the seller's promises of a clean, new, and well-made product. This scenario can be categorized as \u201cSeller is incorrect, and the buyer is dissatisfied.\u201d The significant discrepancy in condition and hygiene suggests a failure in quality assurance or improper handling by the seller. \" The seller is at fault due to quality control issues, as the buyer received an unsanitary and used item that starkly contrasts with the seller's description of a clean, new product, leading to extreme buyer dissatisfaction.",
