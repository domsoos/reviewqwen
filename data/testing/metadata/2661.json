    "review": "I expected the Groot planter to be sturdy and well-made, but it arrived with noticeable cracks and poor paint quality. The description promised eco-friendly and durable material, but this is far from it. Disappointed!",
    "Expected-output": "The buyer's image shows visible cracks and poor paint quality, which contradicts the seller's description of a durable and eco-friendly material. The seller's images display a flawless and well-crafted product, which is inconsistent with the buyer's received item. The fault lies with the seller for not delivering the promised quality.",
