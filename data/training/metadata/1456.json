    "expected-output": "The seller describes the Frido Dual Gel Insoles as premium insoles crafted from high-quality silicone and fabric, offering enhanced comfort, excellent cushioning, and heel protection. These are marketed as ideal for various footwear types like sneakers, shoes, and boots, with features such as flexibility and customization by trimming for size adjustments. The buyer finds the product okay and expresses dissatisfaction with the thinness of the sole, considering it insufficient for the price. They acknowledge flexibility and the ability to adjust the size by cutting but don't perceive the insoles as particularly remarkable. Seller's Image Highlights the insoles' dual-gel technology, showcasing flexibility, cushioning, and a professional finish. Buyer's Image Shows the actual product, which appears thinner and less robust compared to the impressions from the seller's promotional image. The insoles' thinness appears to contradict the seller's emphasis on excellent cushioning. While the product offers flexibility and size customization as advertised, the perceived value for money is lacking, as noted by the buyer. The buyer is dissatisfied due to unmet expectations regarding cushioning and overall value for money. The fault lies partially with the seller's description, which oversells the product's cushioning and premium features, creating a disparity between the promoted and actual product quality.",
