    "review": "This product very poor quality product this product I am use only gym for 1 hour now this choose condition very bad my shoes not damage very bad condition",
    "expected-output": "The seller advertises the shoes as lightweight, breathable, and durable, featuring a washable mesh upper and a sturdy EVA outsole for comfort and versatility, emphasizing their suitability for activities like gym workouts, running, and trekking. However, the buyer expresses strong dissatisfaction, reporting that the shoes deteriorated rapidly after just one hour of gym use, describing them as in very bad condition despite minimal wear. This directly contradicts the seller’s claims of durability and reliability for active use, with the buyer's reasonable expectations unmet. If the buyer’s image confirms visible damage inconsistent with the seller's description, it highlights a significant discrepancy between the promised and delivered product quality. The fault lies with the seller for failing to align the product’s performance with its advertised features, underscoring the need for improved quality control and truthful marketing to maintain customer trust and satisfaction.",
