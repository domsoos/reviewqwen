    "review": "Doesn't work at all.",
    "expected-output": "The seller's description emphasizes the strong bonding and versatile nature of the Loctite Super Glue, as well as its resistance to various elements. However, the buyer's review states that the glue doesn't work at all, which directly contradicts the seller's claims. The seller's description suggests that the glue should bond effectively, but the buyer's experience indicates dissatisfaction. Given this significant discrepancy, the buyer is likely dissatisfied due to a potential product defect or mismatch. The fault likely lies with the seller's product, assuming no misuse on the buyer's part.",
