    "review": "I bought these silver sandals in January for a bachelorette party that took place in Tulum, Mexico in February 2024. They worked perfectly. I'm a size 7, bought a size 7, but they were just a tad too big. Adding another hole to the ankle strap helped. I stopped wearing them because the weather was still too chilly. But I started wearing them more now that it's summer in NYC, and I've been walking around a bunch. I love how lightweight they are, they let me walk with confidence, they give me height (I'm 5 foot 1 inch), I get compliments, they're cute and silver, and always make my outfits a bit more fun! Unfortunately, approximately 3 months of wearing them (they're part of my full time shoe rotation) and the strap has started to peel off, to separate from the sole. So bummed. Now I'm going to try to crazy glue them together but still sucks. I recommend these for people that don't walk as much as a New Yorker. Also don't expect them to last a season if you do! Also, the left shoe has started to feel like it's sinking. And the bottoms are splitting. See pics. Good luck!",
    "expected-output": "Seller's Image vs. Buyer's Image: The seller's image shows a new, pristine pair of platform sandals with an intact sole and no signs of wear. The platform and the straps appear sturdy. The buyer's image shows visible wear on the sandals' soles, with the treads splitting and cracks present. Additionally, the strap appears to be detaching from the sole, showing signs of degradation not present in the seller's image. Seller's Description vs. Buyer's Review: The seller describes the sandals as trendy, lightweight, and featuring a rubber or synthetic sole with a buckle closure. The product is advertised for its fashionable appeal and comfort, especially due to the lightweight build. The buyer's review acknowledges the sandals' initial comfort, light weight, and aesthetic appeal, mentioning they worked well initially and even received compliments. However, the buyer notes several issues after about three months of regular use: splitting soles, peeling straps, and a sinking feel in one shoe. The buyer expresses disappointment, mentioning the need for repairs like gluing the strap back on. Discrepancies and Satisfaction: The buyer is dissatisfied due to the sandals' durability. Although the buyer initially enjoyed the product, they were disappointed by its inability to withstand frequent walking over a few months. The review implies that the sandals may be suitable for occasional or light use but not for someone who walks extensively, as they are prone to structural wear and tear. Conclusion: The buyer's dissatisfaction seems justified, as the product did not meet their durability expectations, especially for regular use in a city environment. The product may have matched the seller's image and description in appearance and comfort initially, but the quality of materials or construction did not hold up over time. This issue lies with the product's durability rather than the buyer's personal opinion, indicating a potential mismatch between product marketing and its real-world use case.",
