    "review": "The jar arrived with no label, making it hard to confirm if it is truly Indigenous Honey. I expected better packaging.",
    "Expected-output": "The buyer's review highlights dissatisfaction due to the lack of labeling on the jar, which is inconsistent with the seller's image showing a properly labeled product. While the seller description emphasizes quality, there is a mismatch here. The buyer's images support their claim. Fault: Seller.",
