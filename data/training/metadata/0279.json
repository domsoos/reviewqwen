    "expected-output": "Seller Description: The Plantex Royal Soap Case/Dish/Holder is crafted from high-quality stainless steel, promising durability, and resistance to rust and corrosion. It is designed for versatile use in the kitchen, bathroom, or near sinks and washbasins, providing a space-efficient way to store soap. The design allows the soap to stay dry due to its drainage-friendly structure. With dimensions of 15.2 cm (L) x 12.5 cm (B) x 10.2 cm (H), the soap holder maintains a gap from the wall to avoid any water damage to nearby surfaces. It is coated with a nickel-chrome finish, which gives it a scratch-resistant, mirror-like appearance. The soap stand includes necessary fittings for easy wall mounting and requires simple periodic maintenance by wiping with a wet and dry cloth. Made in India, the product is ready for use upon delivery. The brand offers a range of other bathroom accessories to complement it. Seller Image: The seller's image shows a sleek and polished stainless steel soap holder with a reflective mirror finish, displaying the soap resting on it in a neat, stylish setup. The product appears scratch-free and exudes a high-quality, elegant look. Buyer Image: The buyer's image, however, shows a soap holder that arrived with noticeable rust spots, particularly along the edges and back. This is inconsistent with the rust-free and high-quality image portrayed in the seller's advertisement. Buyer Review: The buyer expressed dissatisfaction, stating that the product arrived with rust marks, contradicting the seller's claim of a corrosion-resistant stainless steel product. This rust issue is a significant problem, especially given that the product is marketed as rust-resistant, which suggests a failure in quality or finishing during production or storage. Analysis: Upon examining the seller's description, image, and the buyer's experience, there is a clear discrepancy. The seller has marketed the soap holder as being resistant to rust and corrosion due to its stainless steel construction and nickel-chrome coating. This claim is further supported by the clean, polished appearance shown in the seller's image, which gives the impression of a durable, high-quality product. However, the buyer’s experience reveals a different reality. The presence of rust immediately upon delivery indicates that the product does not meet the quality standard promised by the seller. The rust issue could be due to inadequate coating or storage conditions before shipment, leading to corrosion despite the stainless steel material. Conclusion: In this case, the fault appears to lie with the seller, as the product delivered does not align with the advertised description of being rust-resistant. The buyer has a legitimate grievance, as rust is an indication of either poor material quality or inadequate protective coating. The product’s failure to meet advertised standards suggests either a manufacturing defect or a misrepresentation in the product’s resistance to environmental factors.",
