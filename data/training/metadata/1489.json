    "review": "If you are planning to buy this shoes DONT BUY. One of worst company who don't care about their customers.Within 4 days 3 use strap break. 1st layer of shoes started tore. I complained but no one responding.",
    "expected-output": "In assessing the alignment between the seller's promises and the buyer's experience, a thorough analysis of the seller's image and description, the buyer's image, and the buyer's review reveals significant discrepancies. The seller's image and description portray the school shoes as durable, comfortable, and versatile, with specific emphasis on features like easy closure, a sturdy PVC sole, and optimal heel support, marketed under the legacy of Liberty Shoes to build customer trust.However, the buyer's review contradicts these claims, citing that the straps broke and the first layer of the shoes tore after only three uses within four days, a clear failure of the productâ€™s promised durability. The review further criticizes the lack of response from the seller to their complaint, pointing to poor after-sales service. While the buyer's image is not explicitly described, it is presumed to depict visible damage that supports their grievances, contrasting sharply with the pristine depiction in the seller's image.The rapid deterioration of the product and unaddressed complaint highlight a direct misalignment between the seller's marketing claims and the buyer's experience. The fault lies with the seller for failing to deliver a product that meets advertised standards and for inadequate customer service, exacerbating the buyer's dissatisfaction. To rectify such issues, the seller must ensure that product quality aligns with descriptions and establish a responsive after-sales support system to rebuild customer trust and satisfaction.",
