( their batteries refused to recharge after a year). I was about to write a great review until last night when I decided to celebrate with a really good bottle of wine. Sadly the screw went in but did not pull out the cork and mangled it. I tried a second time and part of the cork entered the mechanism and now I cannot get it out despite trying with several sharp instruments. I will see if it can be returned and if so will update my review. The accompanying foil cutter works very well. the customer service was excellent and they replaced my wine opener quickly. The replacement has the corkscrew off to one side so it never goes through the center of the cork. I expect this will soon lead to another broken cork getting stuck. So although I raised from 1 to 3 stars, I cannot in good faith recommend this product.<|image|>Seller Description: Material Stainless Steel Color Silver Finish Type Brushed Brand Secura Item Weight 1.2 Pounds Product Dimensions 11'L x 4.92'W Is Customizable No Manufacturer Secura UPC 638339650261 791507556502 638339651282 Number of Items 1 See less.

Its sleek design, vibrant colors, and unique isometric frame made it the perfect centerpiece for a sports-themed decor. I strung LED lights around the frame, and the result was a glowing masterpiece that draws everyone’s attention. Although I haven’t used it on the court, its lightweight and aerodynamic structure make it a stylish addition to any living space. Highly recommended for adding a sporty and artistic vibe to your home!<|image|>Seller Description: The latest head-light series from Yonex, NANORAY provides a fast and controlled swing with enhanced repulsion via the New Aero Frame. NANORAY is designed for players who force their opponents into the back of the court with extreme speed. The thinner top of the frame sides minimize air resistance for greater head speed, while the thicker sides at the bottom of the head generate maximum repulsion through greater frame stiffness. NANOMESH + CARBON NANOTUBE - New from YONEX: Nanomesh + Carbon Nanotube is an exclusive structural material inserted into the frame and/or shaft of the nanoray series. It significantly increases repulsion power, toughness and impact strength within the racquet. By combining carbon nanotube with a resin, the two molecules create a mesh-like construction which delivers a head-light racquet, sharper drive shots, improved strength and faster handling. ISOMETRIC - The square-shaped ISOMETRIC frame shape is designed to keep vertical strings at a similar length, as well as the horizontal strings to produce an expanded sweet spot in all directions. AERO Frame - Decreases air resistance and realizes a quicker swing. TFA CAP - Provides extra shaft flex to accelerate frame recovery after impact.

This suggests that the seller is highlighting the syrup's versatility and functionality, which is not explicitly mentioned in the buyer description. The buyer description focuses on the syrup's taste and its ability to add a gourmet touch to various drinks, without mentioning its functionality. Therefore, the interaction can be classified as \"Here seller is at fault\" because the seller's description does not align with the buyer's expectations or interests.<|eot_id|>",

The first one I bought was back in 2019 and it was dead after a year of used. It was not that advanced back in the days so basically I was more like babysitting it when was doing the cleaning, I had to guide it thru the whole process,clear obstacles, and manually empty the bin, it created more work for me actually. I even felt so relief when it’s dead. Fast forward 6 years later, we moved into a bigger house with 2 boys, vacuuming everyday is now part of the big deal for me. I am so done with this hectic work! So I decided to give the robot another try, I did my research and carefully chose Robotrock Q5Maxplus this time as my vacuum buddy. At the moment I open the box, I can’t believe how easy the setup is! Just need to scan the code that sticks on top of it, download the Robotrock app on your phone, it will start automatically mapping the entire floor for you. Once you setup the no-go zone hit the start bottom then it can begin the vacuum. I don’t have to watch it doing the work anymore! Neither clean out the bin once the vacuum has done! After using it for almost a week, it has delivered nothing but great results. It helps me swap difficult to clean areas such as areas under the TV cabinet, dining table and coffee table. The auto setting to clean the house at desired time also takes away the manual reminder to clean the house at a certain time, especially when I set it at midnight so I don't need to interfere with the robot while it is doing itss free labor. I wish I could have bought this one years ago, but it’s never too late to get one now, or even more than one for my second floor as well.​<|image|>Seller Description: The Roborock Q5 Max+ Robot Vacuum redefines home cleaning with advanced technology and convenience.

Its lightweight frame and sleek isometric design allowed me to experiment with dynamic shadow effects in my studio.

NANORAY is designed for players who force their opponents into the back of the court with extreme speed. The thinner top of the frame sides minimize air resistance for greater head speed, while the thicker sides at the bottom of the head generate maximum repulsion through greater frame stiffness. NANOMESH + CARBON NANOTUBE - New from YONEX: Nanomesh + Carbon Nanotube is an exclusive structural material inserted into the frame and/or shaft of the nanoray series. It significantly increases repulsion power, toughness and impact strength within the racquet. By combining carbon nanotube with a resin, the two molecules create a mesh-like construction which delivers a head-light racquet, sharper drive shots, improved strength and faster handling. ISOMETRIC - The square-shaped ISOMETRIC frame shape is designed to keep vertical strings at a similar length, as well as the horizontal strings to produce an expanded sweet spot in all directions.

Designed to have the same flight time as a feather shuttle, they give an accurate and durable performance with a traditional feel.

In the cold, as the skirt becomes hard, it is prone to breaking. In the hot, the skirt becomes softer and less likely to break, but the feel at impact is affected by the softer skirt. YONEX manages product quality by categorising MAVIs into 3 temperatures. Please ensure that you choose the shuttlecock best suited to the playing environment.

They eat this like a fast food we like to eat going to a restaurant, but this delicious food could not be actually health if we taste this as a main regular diet. Another important thing about this item is they need enough clean water for drinking everytime they feel thirsty, so keep a big wather pot nearby. Its packaging is good quality is also seems good but color is like kurkure, red and a deep smell of poultry composite. So i am not very sure about it's exact quality because there is no clear description about ingredients. Hence my suggestion to every cat owner please monitor carefully about their health condition and behavior after they eat this item few days. Consult a veterinary doctor immediately if you feel something abnormal. Lastly i using this item only from few weeks hence unable to give conclusive review right now but i will give my opinion next time after 6 month later.<|image|>Seller Description: Whiskas Dry Cat Food offers a complete and balanced meal for your cat, providing essential nutrients for overall health.
