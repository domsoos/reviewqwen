    "expected-output": "The Xiaomi Power Bank, as described by the seller, boasts a 33W super-fast charging capability for both input and output, offering efficient device charging. It includes Type-C input and output ports, compatibility with Power Delivery (PD) and QC 3.0, and smart power management for safe and optimal performance. The seller's images depict a sleek black design consistent with the product's specifications, showcasing its aesthetics and functionality. The buyer's images also align with the advertised design but highlight an issue with performance.The buyer's review mentions dissatisfaction, citing that the power bank charges inadequately, even after extended charging, with the battery depleting too quickly. This contrasts sharply with the seller's claims of efficiency and reliability. The discrepancy lies in the actual performance of the product, which failed to meet the promised standards of charging speed and battery retention.Based on the provided details, the fault appears to lie with the sellerâ€™s product. Despite the accurate visual representation, the core functionality of the power bank did not meet expectations, leading to a negative user experience. This suggests a possible quality control issue or a defective unit rather than a subjective opinion from the buyer.",
