    "review": "Lid and accessories of the purifier was missing when opened the parcel. Return was canceled twice. Nobody was there to attend the complaint. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.",
    "expected-output": "Upon analyzing the data provided, the seller's description portrays the Aquaguard water purifier as a highly reliable and efficient product featuring advanced technologies like Aquasaver for water conservation, a 9-stage purification system, and added benefits such as a free service plan. The product images align with the description, showcasing a sleek, modern design with labels and features consistent with the seller's claims. However, the buyer's review reveals a stark contrast, citing a missing lid and accessories upon opening the parcel and a frustrating experience with unresolved return and complaint processes. The provided buyer image corroborates the review, showing the absence of essential components like the lid, which directly affects the product's usability.The dissatisfaction expressed by the buyer is justified due to the incomplete product delivery, which undermines the seller's promise of a fully functional and premium product. The fault lies predominantly with the seller for failing to ensure proper packaging and fulfillment of the advertised product's components. Furthermore, the ineffective after-sales service exacerbates the issue, leading to a poor customer experience. In conclusion, while the seller's description and visuals appear promising, the execution and delivery of the product failed to meet the buyer's expectations, leaving the seller accountable for the dissatisfaction.",
