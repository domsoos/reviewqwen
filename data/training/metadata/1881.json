    "review": "Bottle is empty worst product",
    "expected-output": "The seller describes the Loctite Super Glue Power Gel as a highly effective adhesive suitable for various materials with a non-drip formula and long-lasting durability. The buyer's review, however, expresses dissatisfaction due to receiving an empty bottle. This represents a clear discrepancy between the seller's promised product and the buyer's experience. The issue likely lies with the seller, as the product was received in an unusable state. The buyer is justified in their dissatisfaction, and the seller is at fault for not ensuring proper packaging or quality control.",
