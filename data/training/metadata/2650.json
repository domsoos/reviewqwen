    "review": "The bulb heats up excessively after just 10 minutes of use, which makes it unusable in my small room. This is not energy-efficient at all.",
    "Expected-output": "The buyer's review mentions excessive heating of the bulb, contradicting the seller's description of energy efficiency and safety features like high voltage and surge protection. The seller's image does not depict any signs of heating issues. The buyer's image does not provide visual evidence of the issue but supports their dissatisfaction. The seller is at fault for the misleading description.",
