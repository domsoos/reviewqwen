    "review": "My child barely had a chance to play with it for a month before it broke. Within just 20 days of use, it stopped working and now sits in the corner of my gallery unused.

    "expected-output": " Seller's Description Analysis The seller markets the 3-wheel Lifelong kick scooter as a durable, child-friendly product with a wide deck capable of supporting up to 50 kg. The lightweight and foldable design is intended for portability, while the BIS and ISI safety certifications emphasize its reliability. The PVC wheels are highlighted as providing smooth navigation, even on rough surfaces. Buyer's Review Analysis The buyer expresses significant dissatisfaction, stating that the scooter broke within 20 days of use and is no longer functional. The early breakdown left their child disappointed, as it was a birthday gift that failed shortly after the celebration. This feedback strongly contradicts the seller's claims of durability and reliability. Analysis of the Images Buyer's Image  The image (not provided for review here) would presumably show signs of damage or the scooter in an unusable state, supporting the buyer’s claim of poor durability. Seller's Image:  The seller's image portrays a sturdy, well-built scooter that suggests long-term usability, which conflicts with the buyer's experience.Discrepancies Identified Durability:  The seller claims the scooter is durable and capable of supporting up to 50 kg, but the buyer reports that it broke within a short period of normal use.2. Reliability: The product's BIS and ISI certifications imply reliability, yet the buyer's experience suggests otherwise. Conclusion The buyer is highly dissatisfied with the product due to its lack of durability and reliability, as it failed within 20 days of use. The fault lies with the product, as it did not meet the seller's claims or the buyer's expectations. This discrepancy undermines the seller’s promise of a robust and reliable scooter, resulting in disappointment for the buyer.",
