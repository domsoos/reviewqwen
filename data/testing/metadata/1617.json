    "review": "Recently purchased grenaro j13 wireless mic to shoot my videos. While shooting in sunlight mic is facing cracking sounds issue. I tried to get help from their technical team. But they are unable to solve problem and also they don't understand the problem. Provided some of my video footages for proof. But found that their team is unable to solve this problem.",
    "expected-output": "The seller describes the Grenaro Wireless Lavalier Microphone as a high-quality audio recording device, emphasizing its advanced features such as noise reduction, long transmission distance, and extended battery life. Additionally, the product comes with a 1-year warranty and technical support. However, the buyer reports encountering cracking sound issues while recording in sunlight, which significantly impacts its functionality. Despite reaching out to the technical support team and providing video proof, the buyer found the team unable to address or resolve the problem effectively. This indicates a failure on the part of the seller, not only in delivering a reliable product but also in providing competent post-sale support as promised.",
