    "review": "These were just delivered, so I haven't worn them yet. I tried them on, and they fit as expected. They seem pretty comfortable too. The first thing I noticed is that they moved the phone pocket from right to left. Why would they do something so stupid? I've been wearing Wrangler cargo shorts for years. The phone pocket has always been on the right, as you would expect, because most people are right-handed. Can someone at Wrangler please explain why the phone pocket is now on the left? Did some new, left-handed designer make this decision? See attached pictures.",
    "expected_output": "The seller describes the cargo shorts as versatile and comfortable, featuring a relaxed fit, durable materials, and functional pockets, including six compartments for convenient storage. The buyer confirms that the shorts fit well and are comfortable but expresses dissatisfaction with the placement of the phone pocket on the left side instead of the right, which deviates from their expectations based on previous experiences with similar products. This design choice, while likely intentional, does not align with the buyer\u2019s preference. There are no issues with the quality or functionality of the product as described by the seller, and the dissatisfaction is rooted in personal expectations rather than a discrepancy or defect. ",
