    "expected-output":"The seller's description highlights the footwear as a high-quality product designed for comfort and durability, featuring a die-cut NR EVA sock liner, soft cushioning for extended use, breathable mesh for ventilation, and reinforced toe stitching for enhanced durability and performance. The seller's image depicts a clean and polished pair of white and black shoes, showcasing agility, flexibility, and stability, suitable for both indoor and outdoor courts. However, the buyer's review expresses disappointment, stating they received a used product, which was not expected. The buyer's image shows a pair of blue shoes with visible signs of wear, further supporting their claim.This clear discrepancy between the seller's description and the buyer's experience highlights a quality control failure. The product received does not align with the seller's promise of a new, pristine item, and the mismatch in color (blue instead of white) adds to the misrepresentation. The buyer's dissatisfaction is justified as their expectations, based on the seller's description and images, were not met.n conclusion, the fault lies with the seller for delivering a product that does not match the advertised description or meet the buyer's expectations of receiving a new item. The seller's lack of quality control and failure to ensure the product's condition align with their promotional claims has led to the buyer's disappointment and dissatisfaction.",
