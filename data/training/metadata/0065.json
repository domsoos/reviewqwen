    "review": "I bought this for my room to cook ramen, put the glass on top while it was cooking and within a minute, the glass exploded. Luckily no one was hurt as I was cooking it with my husband. We were testing it, this was the first time using it. A loud pop sounded and the entire thing was burst and cracked and the top handle was the thing that flew up really high and hard. So scary. Do not buy.",
    "expected-output": "Seller’s Description: The seller describes the DEZIN electric cooking pot as a versatile, non-stick, and portable cooking appliance suitable for cooking a variety of dishes like ramen, steak, chicken, fried rice, and more. The product emphasizes health-conscious cooking by reducing the need for oil and making it easier to clean after use. The pot is equipped with a 600W power rating for fast heating, safety features like over-heating and boil-dry protection, and a compact size ideal for dorms and travel. Buyer’s Experience: The buyer, however, encountered a serious safety issue. During their first use, while cooking ramen, the glass lid reportedly exploded, causing a loud noise and even causing the top handle to fly off. The buyer was alarmed by this incident, describing it as frightening and potentially dangerous. They note that no one was hurt, but the situation raised significant concerns about the product's safety, especially since the explosion occurred with minimal use. Discrepancy: The product description promises safety and durability, with no mention of issues with the lid. However, the buyer’s review reveals that the lid’s durability is far below expectations, resulting in a dangerous failure. This situation suggests a potential flaw in the product’s material or construction, especially regarding the glass lid. Conclusion: The buyer’s experience highlights a critical safety issue that contradicts the seller’s claims of durability and safe usage. The glass lid’s explosion is a significant defect that undermines the product’s reliability and raises concerns about its safety in typical cooking scenarios. This issue should be addressed by the seller to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. The fault lies with the seller due to the defective glass lid, which is not consistent with the advertised safety features. Despite the product's advertised functionality and versatility, the buyer's experience points to a major flaw in the lid's durability, presenting a safety hazard that should have been avoided in the product's design or quality control process.\" }",
