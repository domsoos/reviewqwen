    "review": "The earbuds don't come in the color I wanted. I was hoping for a bright red version, but only black and blue were available.",
    "Expected-output": "The buyer\u2019s review focuses on the lack of a specific color option, which is unrelated to the seller\u2019s description or promises. The seller has not claimed availability in bright red or other specific colors beyond what is shown in the images. The product delivered matches the description and images, and the dissatisfaction stems from the buyer's personal preference, not the seller\u2019s fault.",
