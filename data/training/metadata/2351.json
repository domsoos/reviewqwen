    "review": "I have bought these several times. I was hesitant as the OZ was .25 different and all the bad reviews. I double checked to make sure that it was the same link I bough previously and it was. When I got them I compared them in detail. They seem to be the same size, same Dove soap, they do seem more scented however I opened an old box and a new box. I used both soaps. I think because I do not have to buy bar soap often when you buy 2 -8 packs for a great price the soap i have been using actually smelled old more than the new ones being more scented as I don't think to rotate soap so the 4 oz bars could have been bought 2xs ago?! Both lathered the same, moisturize the same and I'm hypersensitive to soaps especially bar, laundry detergent ect. No reaction. Doesn't have any questions of being a fraud? I feel it is the same Dove sensitive bar soap I buy online and in stores. Even the size wasn't a big difference. Comes in 2 individually wrapped 8 bar packs with another do not break packaging. I took pictures so you can see. Hope this helps from my date of purchase as this is a great price for great soap!",
