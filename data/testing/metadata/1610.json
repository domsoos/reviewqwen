    "expected-output": "The seller describes the 38-inch acoustic guitar as a stylish and durable instrument with a linden wood body, ebony wood fretboard, and a glossy black finish. The product is marketed as offering high-quality sound, enhanced resonance, and easy tuning through its geared tuning system and steel strings. The package is positioned as an all-in-one solution, including accessories such as a strap, bag, string set, and picks. The seller\u2019s image portrays a premium product consistent with these promises. However, the buyer\u2019s review indicates dissatisfaction, citing that the guitar broke after falling from a low-height bed. This directly challenges the seller\u2019s claims of durable construction, as the product failed to withstand a minor impact, raising concerns about its build quality. The buyer\u2019s image, if provided, would likely corroborate this defect, emphasizing the fragility of the guitar.Conclusion:The buyer is dissatisfied due to the guitar\u2019s inability to endure minimal physical stress, contradicting the seller\u2019s assertions of durability and quality construction. The fault lies with the seller, as the product does not meet the durability standards advertised. This suggests a potential issue with material quality or manufacturing processes. To address such issues, the seller should improve quality control and reinforce the product\u2019s build to align with customer expectations and advertised claims.",
