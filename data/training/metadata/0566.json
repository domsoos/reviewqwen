    "review": "At least three of the 12 packages in this box contained mold. I don't know if more packages are moldy as they haven't been opened. Upon closer examination, the expiration date on these bars had already EXPIRED when delivered to me. Buyer beware!!! Zero stars if it was an option.",
    "expected-output": "Seller Description and Image: The seller’s description and image emphasize the freshness, quality, and plant-based, whole-grain ingredients in the Nature's Bakery Fig Bars. The image portrays a raspberry variant, filled with real fruit, with an emphasis on soft-baked, healthy snacks that are safe, vegan, kosher, and nut-free. Buyer Review and Image: The buyer’s review, however, reveals significant issues with the product's freshness and quality. According to the buyer, at least three packages were moldy upon arrival. Furthermore, the expiration date on the product was already expired when it was delivered, which raises concerns about storage, quality checks, and freshness. The buyer expresses deep dissatisfaction, giving a hypothetical zero-star rating. Discrepancy: The buyer's experience does not align with the seller’s promise of a high-quality, fresh product. While the seller advertises the bars as wholesome and satisfying for on-the-go snacking, the buyer received an expired, moldy product, contradicting the claim of a fresh, nutritious snack. Conclusion: The buyer is understandably dissatisfied due to receiving an expired and compromised product, which does not match the seller's description or visual representation. This fault lies with either the seller or the logistics chain responsible for the product’s storage and delivery. It appears to be a case of poor quality control or mishandling during distribution rather than an issue with the product's inherent quality when fresh.\" The seller is at fault due to a failure in quality control or storage management, as the product arrived expired and moldy, contradicting the advertised freshness and quality. This significant discrepancy resulted in deep buyer dissatisfaction, highlighting a need for stricter checks to ensure product integrity upon delivery.",
