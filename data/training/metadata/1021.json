    "expected_output": "The seller's description portrays a high-quality car duster crafted with specially wax-treated cotton strands to ensure scratch-free and efficient cleaning. The duster is marketed as reusable, washable, and eco-friendly, providing practical utility for cleaning vehicles. The seller's images display a clean and well-packaged product, emphasizing its functionality and new condition. However, the buyer's review highlights a significant discrepancy, reporting that they received a used product instead of a new one. The buyer's image corroborates this claim, as it shows a visibly used and dirty duster, which starkly contrasts with the pristine condition depicted in the seller's images. This situation indicates a clear lapse in quality control or inventory management by the seller. The buyer's dissatisfaction is justified as the product they received does not meet the promised standards of a new and unused item. The fault lies squarely with the seller for failing to deliver the product as described and advertised.",
