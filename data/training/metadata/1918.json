    "review": "It's a little hard and if your neck is small, then only it will fit.",
    "expected_output": "The seller\u2019s description promises a neck pillow designed for comfort and portability, suitable for various environments like cars, trains, flights, and the office, with a focus on relieving neck pain and providing support during naps. The seller image depicts a soft and supportive neck pillow, while the buyer's review mentions that the pillow is a bit hard and suggests that it fits better on those with smaller necks. The pillow appears to be consistent with the seller's description in terms of its design and intended use, though the buyer\u2019s feedback about its firmness and fit indicates that the pillow may not meet everyone\u2019s comfort needs. The discrepancy lies in the buyer's specific comfort requirement, not a flaw in the product itself, as the description focused on general comfort but did not specifically mention suitability for all neck sizes. Thus, the fault seems to rest with the buyer's personal preferences rather than a product defect.",
