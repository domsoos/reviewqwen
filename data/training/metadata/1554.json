    "review": "Whiskas is a good product. And Amazon customer service rocks. This is a review for the seller - 2 of them in fact - E trade and Zigly. I received damaged boxes (likely by rats) on 2 separate occasions. With several sachets cut up and the stale food causing a big stink. Luckily, Amazon provided a full refund.
