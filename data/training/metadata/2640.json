    "review": "I expected these earbuds to include active noise cancellation, but they don\u2019t have that feature.",
    "Expected-output": "The buyer incorrectly assumed the earbuds would have active noise cancellation. The seller's description does not mention or promise this feature. The dissatisfaction is due to a false assumption by the buyer, as the product matches the seller's description and images, with no fault on the seller\u2019s part.",
