    "Review": "The kayak's material feels thin and started to wear out after a single day of use. The quality is below expectations.",
    "Expected-output": "The buyer highlighted issues with the material quality, showing visible wear after minimal use. This does not align with the seller's claim of 'enhanced molecular formulation PVC for long-lasting use.' The seller is at fault for not meeting the quality standards as advertised.",
