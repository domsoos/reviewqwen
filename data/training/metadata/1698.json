    "seller_description": "This Bansuri features a Lip-Plate design that makes blowing effortless, eliminating the need to spend hours mastering the technique. It is finely tuned with a Tanpura to ensure accurate notes, providing a rich and harmonious sound. The Bansuri requires no maintenance as it is washable, resistant to the effects of direct sunlight, and remains durable with no cracks or splits even after aging or drops from up to 8 feet in height. An extra hole is included to enable playing of both Lower and Higher Tivra Ma, perfect for use in Gamak and Meend. The yellow color finish closely resembles the traditional bamboo Bansuri. Additionally, the included Bansuri manual provides essential information such as how to hold the instrument, play scales, finger positioning, and tips on care and maintenance, making it a perfect choice for both beginners and experienced players.",
    "review": "I request the supplier not to dispatch broken flute. Adhesive also seen , tried to past the flute unsuccessfully.Sound quality good but broken",
    "expected-output": "The buyer's review expresses dissatisfaction with the condition of the Bansuri flute, reporting that it arrived broken and had visible adhesive used in an attempt to fix it. Despite this, the buyer acknowledges the good sound quality of the flute, which aligns with the seller's description, emphasizing that the instrument is finely tuned for accurate notes and a rich, harmonious sound. The seller also promises a durable and maintenance-free Bansuri, resistant to cracks or splits, which is contradicted by the buyer’s report of the flute being broken upon arrival.Upon examining the seller's image and the buyer’s image, both show the same Bansuri flute design, so there is no discrepancy in the visual appearance of the product. However, the issue raised by the buyer regarding the flute being broken upon delivery suggests a problem with the product’s condition during shipment or packaging. This seems to be a shipping or quality control issue, as the seller’s description clearly states that the flute is durable and resistant to damage.The fault in this case lies with the seller, as the buyer received a damaged product, which directly contradicts the seller's claims about the Bansuri's durability and quality. While the sound quality was appreciated, the physical damage to the flute and the use of adhesive to attempt a repair highlights a failure in ensuring the product was shipped in proper condition. Therefore, the seller is at fault for sending a damaged product, even though the product's described features were accurate in terms of sound quality.",
