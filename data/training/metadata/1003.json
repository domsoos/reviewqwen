    "review": "There's no separate chamber to eject the dirty water. The water will continue to mix in the chamber repeatedly and it's not hygienic Such an useless product, trying to return the product but there's no option - only replacement Anyone who's reading this please don't buy I am struck with this. Please don't waste your money on it.",
    "expected-output": "The seller\u2019s description of the Twin Bucket Spin Mop emphasizes features such as a dual-bucket system for efficient rinsing and wringing, a microfibre mop for superior cleaning, and a 360-degree telescopic handle for accessing hard-to-reach corners. It also mentions adjustable, detachable handles and durable construction, positioning the product as a convenient and versatile cleaning solution. However, there is no explicit mention in the description about whether the dual-bucket system separates clean water from dirty water, which is a critical aspect of hygiene in cleaning products.The buyer's review, on the other hand, highlights a significant flaw in the product's design, specifically the absence of a separate chamber to eject dirty water. This design issue leads to repeated mixing of clean and dirty water, which the buyer finds unhygienic and counterproductive. Furthermore, the buyer expresses frustration about being unable to return the product, as the seller offers only a replacement option, leaving the buyer dissatisfied and feeling stuck with an undesirable product.Upon analyzing the alignment between the seller's description and the buyer's experience, it becomes evident that while the seller has highlighted several features of the mop, they have omitted an important detail about the functionality of the dual-bucket system. The description implies an efficient and hygienic cleaning experience but does not clarify how the buckets manage clean and dirty water separately. This omission has likely led to unmet expectations for the buyer, resulting in their dissatisfaction. Additionally, the lack of a clear return policy further aggravates the buyer's frustration.In conclusion, the fault lies predominantly with the seller for providing an incomplete description of the product's functionality, which has directly impacted the buyer's experience. By failing to clarify the limitations of the bucket system and the return policy, the seller has created a disconnect between the advertised features and the buyer's expectations. While the buyer could have conducted more thorough research or read reviews before purchasing, the primary responsibility rests with the seller for not addressing critical design aspects in their description.",
