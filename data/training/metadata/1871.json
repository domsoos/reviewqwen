    "review": "Material is very nice and good,i received colour lighter than shown in picture and too tight on my shoulder, i want to return but it's showing non returnable,",
    "expected-output": "The seller's description provides a detailed account of the scrub suit's material, design, and fit, emphasizing comfort, durability, and functionality with four pockets and a V-neck style. The buyer's review indicates that while they are satisfied with the material's quality, there is a discrepancy regarding the color, which was lighter than expected, and the fit, which was too tight around the shoulders. Additionally, the buyer is dissatisfied with the return policy, as the product is marked as non-returnable. The fault seems to lie with the seller's product color representation and possibly the fit, which did not align with the buyer's expectations. The buyer's dissatisfaction appears to stem from these issues, rather than the quality of the material itself.",
