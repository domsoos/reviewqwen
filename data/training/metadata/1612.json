    "review": "The sound quality was good but I didn't get the string winder along with it. Unfortunately, I am disappointed",
    "expected-output": "The seller describes the 38-inch acoustic guitar as a stylish and functional instrument, offering high-quality sound with a durable linden wood body, ebony wood fretboard, and a glossy black finish. The package is marketed as an all-in-one solution, including accessories such as a strap, bag, string set, and three picks. The seller's image showcases the guitar as sleek and visually appealing, aligning with the detailed description. The buyerâ€™s review acknowledges the good sound quality of the guitar but expresses disappointment due to the absence of a string winder, which they expected to be included. Although the string winder was not explicitly mentioned in the seller's description, the buyer's expectation of its inclusion may have been influenced by other products or common guitar accessory packages.Conclusion:The buyer is partially satisfied with the product, appreciating its sound quality but expressing disappointment over the missing string winder. While the seller is not directly at fault since the description does not promise a string winder, the buyer's dissatisfaction reflects a gap in managing expectations. The fault in this situation lies more with unclear communication of what the package includes rather than the product's quality. To avoid similar issues, the seller could enhance clarity by explicitly listing all included accessories in the product description, ensuring buyers have a precise understanding of what to expect.",
