    "review": "I bought this to use as a small heater. I simply put it on the ground and it heats up the room for a while. After running it for 30 minutes, it feels warmer. The size is great for portability, but I think it's not intended to work as a primary heat source for larger spaces. It's been running fine so far, no overheating or anything. Just make sure to keep it away from flammable items. I do like how easy it is to set up and use.",
    "expected-output": "Seller's Description: The electric hot plate is designed as a versatile, portable device, perfect for light-duty cooking tasks such as in dorms or for outdoor use. The key features highlighted include an adjustable temperature knob, heat distribution coils, and non-slip feet, ensuring stability during use. The product is compact, with a slim design suitable for limited spaces. It\u2019s meant to be used for up to 60 minutes in a two-hour period, emphasizing its light-duty functionality. Buyer\u2019s Review: The buyer\u2019s review clearly deviates from the seller\u2019s intended purpose of the product, using the hot plate as a small heater rather than for cooking. Despite the different use case, the buyer expresses satisfaction with its performance, noting that it provides warmth in smaller spaces and is portable for easy setup. The review does not mention any issues with overheating or poor performance during use. Discrepancies: There is a clear discrepancy in the product\u2019s use case. While the seller markets it for cooking, the buyer uses it as a space heater, which is not its intended purpose. However, this alternative use does not seem to present any issues for the buyer, though it is not the product's primary design. Conclusion: The product serves the buyer\u2019s needs for warming smaller spaces, but this is not the intended use according to the seller's description. The product\u2019s limitations regarding continuous use and its intended cooking functions are not fully acknowledged by the buyer. However, the buyer is satisfied with how it works within these limitations. Fault: The fault does not lie with the seller or buyer in this case. The product is being used for a non-standard purpose, and while the buyer is satisfied with its performance as a space heater, this is outside the scope of the product's intended functionality. The seller's description clearly indicates a use case that the buyer has not followed.\"",
