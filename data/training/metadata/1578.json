    "review": "It is truly appalling that a sealed pack of food was found to be rotten. The product is not liable for replacement or refund either. Calling this a gross lapse of quality standards would be an understatement.",
    "expected-output": "The seller describes Pedigree Wet Dog Food as a complete and balanced meal made with real meat and high-quality protein, featuring a gravylicious flavor loved by puppies. It is marketed to support hydration with high moisture content and promote strong muscles, bones, brain development, and vision through key nutrients like calcium, DHA, Vitamin E, and Selenium. However, the buyer reports a negative experience with a sealed pack being rotten, expressing frustration as the product was not eligible for replacement or refund, highlighting significant lapses in quality control and customer service. To address these issues, the seller should improve quality assurance measures, implement clear and supportive refund or replacement policies, and reassure potential buyers about the steps taken to ensure product safety and reliability, thus restoring trust and confidence in the brand.",
