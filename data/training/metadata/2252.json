    "Expected_output": "The seller\u2019s description of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes highlights their effectiveness in killing 99.9% of viruses and bacteria, their TripleWeave texture for superior cleaning, and their versatility on various surfaces. The seller\u2019s image portrays neatly packed canisters with clear labels, showcasing the scents and functionality of the product. The buyer\u2019s image aligns well with the seller\u2019s depiction, showing identical canisters with the correct branding and advertised features like the \u201cKills 99.9% of Viruses & Bacteria\u201d label. However, the buyer\u2019s review is absent, leaving no feedback on their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the product's performance. Based on the provided visuals and the alignment between the seller's promises and the buyer\u2019s images, the product appears to meet expectations. There are no discrepancies in the product\u2019s appearance or features, and the seller has delivered as promised. Any further insights on usability would require direct buyer input, but the seller\u2019s representation remains faultless.",
