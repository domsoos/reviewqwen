    "review": "The sound quality is nowhere near what was promised in the description. The noise cancellation is barely noticeable, and there\u2019s a constant static noise. Very disappointed with the performance.",
    "Expected-output": "The buyer is dissatisfied due to the lack of noise cancellation and poor sound quality, which were key features highlighted in the seller's description. The seller images showcase a high-end product with claims of exceptional audio performance and noise cancellation, but the buyer's review contradicts these promises. The product's inability to meet the promised standards suggests the fault lies with the seller's product not delivering as described.",
