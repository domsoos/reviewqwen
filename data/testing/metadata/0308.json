    "expected-output": "Seller's Image and Description: The seller’s image shows an elegant, modern side table with a marble-look top and gold-toned frame. The table has a sleek, unique design with a curved structure and an additional small shelf below the main tabletop, suitable for decoration or placing small items. This image conveys a luxurious, sturdy aesthetic, fitting well in a modern or contemporary setting. The description provided highlights the table’s appeal as a functional and stylish piece, though specific materials and assembly details are not described here, leaving some assumptions about the weight and stability to the buyer’s interpretation. Buyer’s Image and Review: Buyer’s Image: The buyer’s image shows the same design and color scheme, with the table placed in a room setting similar to the seller’s image. However, the table’s small size relative to the room might imply that it appears less substantial than expected, potentially affecting its perceived durability and stability. Review: The buyer mentions purchasing the table with the expectation that it would be metal. They were disappointed to find that it was plastic instead, expressing concerns about the table's stability when holding heavier items. While they appreciate the design, the buyer was hoping for a more solid feel, indicating a disconnect between their expectations and the actual product. Comparison and Conclusion: Visual and Functional Alignment: The table’s design and appearance in the buyer’s image align with the seller’s image and the aesthetic promoted. However, the material discrepancy (plastic instead of metal) was a surprise to the buyer, leading to disappointment. This is partly due to the lack of material specification in the seller’s description, which may have led the buyer to assume it was a more solid metal structure. The plastic material also brings into question the table’s stability when holding heavier items, as noted by the buyer. Buyer Satisfaction: The buyer is somewhat dissatisfied due to their expectations of a sturdier, metal table. Their concerns about stability reflect this unmet expectation, though they still appreciate the table’s design. This disappointment stems from an assumption rather than a clear misrepresentation by the seller. Final Assessment: The seller provided an accurate visual representation of the table's appearance, but the lack of material specification in the description contributed to the buyer’s assumption that the table would be metal. This omission led to the buyer's unmet expectation of a heavier, more stable piece. Although the product matches the seller’s images in terms of design, the use of plastic instead of metal has affected the buyer’s perception of quality and stability. In this case, while the seller did not explicitly misrepresent the product, they could improve clarity by specifying the materials in their description to avoid similar assumptions by future buyers. The buyer’s dissatisfaction is based on their interpretation and expectations, so neither party is entirely at fault; however, greater transparency about the materials would likely improve customer satisfaction.",
