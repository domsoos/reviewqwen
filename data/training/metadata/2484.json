    "seller_description": "Keep your beverages at the perfect temperature with the Ember Mug 2, designed to provide up to 80 minutes of consistent warmth (120\u00b0F to 145\u00b0F) or all-day heating on its charging coaster. Perfect for desk use or as a thoughtful gift, this smart mug ensures your drink stays just the way you like it. Use the Ember app to set precise temperatures and receive notifications, or enjoy standalone functionality with a default temperature of 135\u00b0F and memory of your last setting for a hassle-free experience. Equipped with auto-sleep and motion sensors, the mug wakes up when hot liquid is poured and sleeps when not in use, ensuring your drink is always ready. The scratch-resistant coating makes it safe for hand washing, and its IPX7 rating allows for full submersion up to 1 meter. A smart LED indicator lets you know when your drink has reached the perfect temperature. The Ember Mug 2 is an innovative, easy-to-use solution for keeping your favorite hot drinks at their best.",
    "review": "The mug stopped heating after just two weeks of use. While the app shows the temperature settings, the actual heating mechanism no longer works. Very disappointed with the durability.",
    "Expected-output": "The buyer's images show a non-functioning mug, while the seller's images highlight a sleek and innovative design. The seller's description promises up to 80 minutes of consistent heating, but the buyer reports functionality issues after limited use. This discrepancy indicates that the product may have failed to deliver the promised durability. The fault lies with the seller as the product did not perform as advertised.",
