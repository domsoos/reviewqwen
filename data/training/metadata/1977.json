    "seller_description": "This durable navy blue nylon travel bag features a hard-shell design with five compartments: one main compartment, two front pockets, and two side pockets, providing ample space for organization. With smooth-rolling wheels, it ensures easy maneuverability during travel. The bag is made from long-lasting nylon fabric, offering extra durability, while the additional side corner guards provide extra protection when the wheels are in use. Although it is water-resistant, it is not fully waterproof, making it a reliable choice for most weather conditions. The bag's dimensions are 56 cm x 28 cm x 33 cm (LxWxH), and it is not designed for laptop compatibility.",
    "review": "Delivered product was not the same as displayed in app. So get ready yorself to purchase first copy of duplicate type item. Although the product is not bad in this price 389/-, but the expectation after viewing images in app it will be disappointing.",
    "expecetd-output": "The buyer expresses dissatisfaction due to receiving a product that does not match the one displayed in the app, indicating that the bag appears to be a first copy or duplicate. While they acknowledge that the product is acceptable for the price of 389/-, the mismatch between the expectations set by the images and the actual product led to disappointment. The seller\u2019s description of the bag aligns with the features and specifications of the product, such as the durable nylon fabric, smooth-rolling wheels, and ample storage. However, the discrepancy in appearance and quality may be due to misleading images or poor quality control. In this case, the fault lies with the seller for not accurately representing the product in the images, leading to the buyer\u2019s dissatisfaction.",
