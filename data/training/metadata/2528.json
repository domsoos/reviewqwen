    "review": "The suction power is nowhere near 35000PA as advertised. It struggles to pick up even small debris on carpets.",
    "Expected-output": "The buyer is dissatisfied due to the poor suction power, which does not align with the seller's claim of high suction force at 35000PA. The seller's description and images create a high expectation that is not met in the buyer's experience. The seller is at fault for exaggerating the performance.",
