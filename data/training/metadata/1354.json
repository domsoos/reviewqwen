    "review": "It was an unpleasant experience with these gloves. The gloves were received with a number of stitches coming off and threads dangling. There were atleast two spots where the two stitched layers were getting separated (torn). The gloves leave a black chemical(dye) residue on the palms which is just not acceptable, lookwise or healthwise.This made me ponder as to whether these gloves are first rate items or factory-seconds. Also came to my mind were the misleading sort of 4 plus star ratings of the product( I did come across a recent small review by a customer reporting similar issues).What's the profile of such coustomers or is it a steep decline in the quality of the product, it needs to be left to the product-evaluation team Amazon India, needs urgent action.",
