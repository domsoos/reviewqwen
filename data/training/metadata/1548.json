    "expected-output": "The seller describes Whiskas Adult Wet Cat Food as a nutritious and hydrating meal designed to support overall cat health. The buyer reported receiving three damaged pouches that had a bad smell, detracting from their experience. While the product itself aligns with the seller's description in terms of intended benefits, the damaged pouches indicate issues with packaging and handling during shipping. The fault lies with the seller for not ensuring proper packaging to prevent such incidents.",
