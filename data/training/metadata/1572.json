    "expected-output": " The seller promotes Chappi Adult Dry Dog Food (Chicken & Rice) as a complete and balanced meal for adult dogs aged one year and older. It contains high-quality ingredients like chicken and rice, designed to be easily digestible and suitable for sensitive dogs. Enriched with essential vitamins and minerals, the food is said to promote digestive health, muscle support, and natural defense. However, the buyer mentioned using the product regularly but reported that this batch had a bad smell, leading them to describe the food as worthless. The issue with the odor indicates a potential quality control problem, possibly due to poor storage, expiration, or manufacturing faults. To address such concerns, the seller should improve quality control processes, ensure proper storage and handling, and verify batch freshness. Proactive communication with the buyer, including offering a replacement or refund, could help restore trust. Additionally, reviewing shipping and storage conditions to maintain product quality throughout the supply chain would prevent similar issues in the future. Taking these steps would enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty.",
