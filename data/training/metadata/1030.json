    "expected-output": "The seller advertises a convenient electric water dispenser designed to eliminate the need for heavy lifting, claiming it is ideal for women, senior citizens, and use in various settings like offices, hotels, and outdoor activities. The product is described as easy to install and carry, with features including a waterproof silicon-capped button for one-touch dispensing, a food-grade silicon tube, and a safe, energy-efficient DC adapter. The seller\u2019s image highlights a sleek and versatile design for portable use in multiple scenarios. The buyer\u2019s review indicates significant dissatisfaction, stating that the device does not work, does not charge even after 12 hours, and the warranty promised on the platform does not appear accessible. The provided buyer's image shows the device charging with a red light, supporting the claim that the product is unresponsive and not functioning as expected. While the product's appearance aligns with the seller's visual description, the functional issues and lack of clarity regarding warranty support contradict the seller\u2019s claims of reliability and durability. The fault lies with the seller due to the product failing to meet operational expectations and the lack of accessible warranty support, leaving the buyer understandably dissatisfied. ",
