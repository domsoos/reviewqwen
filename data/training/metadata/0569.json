    "review": "I would not have purchased if I knew they would be out of date in 12 days. We normally limit to 1 bag a day. We get the individual serving size that is more expense per oz vs a family bag to easily regulate. This was Frito Lay clearing out old product. At the grocery store you know the deal is because a product is almost at its best by date with prime day 'deal' you do not. We feel conned.",
    "expected-output": "Seller's Image & Description: The seller\u2019s image displays a variety pack containing multiple snack bags from Frito-Lay, indicating a fresh selection of popular snacks like Cheetos, Lay's, Funyuns, and Doritos. The description highlights that this is a 40-count box of individual chip bags, without specifying the expiration dates or time to expiration. The product dimensions and weight are also provided, but there\u2019s no mention of freshness guarantees or recent production dates. Buyer\u2019s Image & Review: The buyer\u2019s image shows a close-up of one of the bags (Funyuns) with a clear expiration date of 30 July 2024. However, the buyer notes that they purchased the pack on Prime Day, and it arrived with the snacks having only 12 days left until expiration. The buyer expresses dissatisfaction, feeling \"conned\" due to the short shelf life of the products, which limits their ability to use them as intended over time. Comparison: Expiration Issue: The main discrepancy lies in the freshness. The seller's description does not explicitly disclose how close to expiration the snacks may be upon delivery, while the buyer expected a longer shelf life for regular use over a period (one snack per day). The seller does not advertise these items as nearing expiration, which would have aligned better with the buyer's experience. Expectation of Shelf Life: While the seller\u2019s image and description show a variety pack, it lacks any freshness guarantee or notice of a clearance. This absence may mislead consumers who expect fresher products, especially when buying in bulk. The buyer\u2019s disappointment stems from discovering that the product was closer to expiration than anticipated, leading to a mismatch in expectations. Conclusion: The buyer is dissatisfied due to the short shelf life, which they feel was not adequately disclosed by the seller. The dissatisfaction appears to be a result of an expectation of freshness, which was not met. This situation might have been avoided if the seller had indicated that the snacks were close to their expiration date, especially since it was sold as a \"deal\" on Prime Day.\" The seller is at fault for not disclosing the short shelf life of the snacks, leading to the buyer's disappointment. Although the product itself was as described, the close expiration date did not meet the buyer's expectations for freshness. Better transparency on the product's expiration timeline, especially during promotional sales, could prevent such dissatisfaction.",
