    "review": "I have been ordering 24-Pack Ramen Noodles for several years. The packages come in an open top box that is shrink wrapped. Although the shrink wrap was unbroken, 2 packs were empty and 1 was partially empty. There was less than a teaspoon of noodles in the carton, so the packs were not broken in transit. Are these packets being broken into by rodents in the factory or warehouse and shrink wrapped for shipping out anyway? This could be a health hazard!",
    "expected-output": "Seller Description and Image: The seller description provides details about the product, specifying a 24-pack of Maruchan Chicken Flavor Ramen Noodle Soup. The seller image displays a full box of intact packages, neatly arranged. The packaging in the seller's image is pristine, with no visible damage or irregularities. Buyer Image and Review: The buyer's image reveals multiple packages with severe damage, showing torn packaging and spilled contents. This damage is concerning, as some packs appear to be partially or completely empty. The buyer expressed dissatisfaction, noting that the packages arrived damaged. The buyer suspects potential contamination from rodents, as the shrink wrap was unbroken, indicating that the damage likely occurred prior to shipping. Discrepancies: Condition of Packaging: The condition of the product in the buyer's image significantly differs from the sellerâ€™s portrayal of a new, undamaged item. The severe damage observed in the buyer's images, coupled with the suspicion of contamination, suggests a possible issue with storage or handling before packaging. Potential Health Hazard: The buyer raises concerns about contamination, speculating that rodents may have accessed the packages prior to shrink-wrapping. This discrepancy highlights a potential quality control issue that poses a health risk. Conclusion: Buyer Satisfaction: The buyer is dissatisfied due to the damaged and potentially contaminated product. The fault appears to lie with the seller or manufacturer, as the damage likely occurred before packaging. Recommendation: Given the buyer's experience, there may be a quality control issue with the storage or handling of these items before packaging. The seller should address this concern to prevent future incidents and ensure customer safety.\" The seller is at fault due to a quality control issue, as multiple damaged and potentially contaminated packages suggest poor handling or storage prior to packaging. This discrepancy from the advertised condition led to buyer dissatisfaction and concerns about product safety.",
