    "review": "Not working when pressing. Total waste of money. First order, nozzle not supplied. Second order, nozzle not working. Waste mechanism.",
    "expected-output": "The seller describes the Loctite TITE FOAM Big Gaps sealant as a high-performance product designed to fill, seal, and insulate gaps and cracks up to 3 inches. It claims to offer excellent durability, superior insulation, and flexibility, making it suitable for various building materials. The product is meant to withstand UV rays and building movements without compromising the seal. In contrast, the buyer's review expresses dissatisfaction, mentioning that the product failed to work properly in two separate orders. The first order had a missing nozzle, and in the second, the nozzle was not functioning, rendering the product unusable. The buyer is clearly dissatisfied with the productâ€™s performance, particularly with the functionality of the nozzle, which is essential for its application. Based on the review, the fault appears to lie with the seller's quality control, as the buyer experienced consistent issues with the nozzle across different orders.",
