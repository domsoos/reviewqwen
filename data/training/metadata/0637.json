    "review": "I was over a friend's house for New Years and she was opening wine bottles with an electric wine opener, if not this brand then a similar one. First of all I didn't know these existed, second of all my fave colour is blue so when I saw that blue light come on, it was a bonus to wanting one. So as soon as I got home I ordered one for myself and then I order more for my friends as their christmas presents the following year. It's very straight forward to use and I liked that it comes with a foil opener. Overall this wine opener has made opening wine so much easier and saves me the embarrassment of how weak I am with a regular opener haha.",
