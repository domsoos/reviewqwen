    "review": "The solar charging functionality barely works, taking an entire day under direct sunlight to gain minimal charge. This renders the solar feature impractical for outdoor use.",
    "Expected-output": "The seller\u2019s description emphasizes reliable solar charging, but the buyer\u2019s review highlights severe inefficiency, which is evident in the reported extended charging times. This discrepancy indicates the seller\u2019s description overstates the product's capabilities, placing fault on the seller.",
