    "review": "The logo embossing is barely visible, and the bag doesn\u2019t have the premium feel it claims to have. Feels cheap and unimpressive.",
    "Expected-output": "The seller highlights a self-embossed logo on high-quality material for a premium feel. The buyer's image depicts a faint and poorly embossed logo, which does not align with the seller's promise of a premium product. Although the bag's overall shape and size are consistent with the seller's description, the subpar logo quality diminishes its appeal. The fault lies with the seller for not delivering the premium quality advertised.",
