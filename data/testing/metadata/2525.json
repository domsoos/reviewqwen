    "review": "The dash cam overheats frequently during longer drives, and the app crashes consistently, making it impossible to access footage when needed.",
    "Expected-output": "The seller described the product as heat-resistant and equipped with a user-friendly app for seamless access to footage. Contrary to these claims, the buyer's review points to overheating issues and frequent app crashes, which impede usability and reliability. The discrepancies between the advertised and actual performance place the fault on the seller for failing to deliver as promised.",
