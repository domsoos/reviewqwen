    "seller_description": "Yonex precision MAVIS Nylon shuttlecocks are the closest you can get to traditional feather. Designed to have the same flight time as a feather shuttle, they give an accurate and durable performance with a traditional feel. Players should always use the shuttlecocks best suited to the playing environment. The hardness of the skirt \u2013 the feather part of the nylon shuttlecock \u2013 varies depending on temperature. In the cold, as the skirt becomes hard, it is prone to breaking. In the hot, the skirt becomes softer and less likely to break, but the feel at impact is affected by the softer skirt. YONEX manages product quality by categorising MAVIs into 3 temperatures. Please ensure that you choose the shuttlecock best suited to the playing environment.
