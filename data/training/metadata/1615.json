    "seller_description": "This C Natural Transverse Flute is tuned at 440Hz for optimum accuracy, making it a reliable alternative to the bamboo flute. It requires no maintenance, is washable, and is highly durable—resistant to cracks, direct sunlight, and even drops from up to 8 feet. The flute is designed for longevity, with no splitting or effects from aging. It comes with 10 tutorial videos, covering everything from how to blow the flute to playing tunes and songs. For added protection, it includes a velvet cover and a cardboard tube that doubles as a hard case.",
    "review": "They just make several holes on PVC pipe.",
    "expected-output": "The seller describes the C Natural Transverse Flute as a durable, high-quality instrument tuned at 440Hz, resistant to damage, and accompanied by features like tutorial videos, a velvet cover, and a protective case. The seller’s image reflects a polished, professional product, aligning with these claims. However, the buyer’s review expresses strong dissatisfaction, dismissing the flute as a simple PVC pipe with holes, indicating a perceived lack of craftsmanship and quality. This starkly contrasts with the seller’s promises of a reliable and well-designed instrument. The fault lies with the seller for failing to meet the advertised standards of quality and construction, highlighting a significant gap between the marketed product and the buyer’s experience. Improved quality control or clearer communication of the product’s materials and design is needed to align customer expectations with reality.",
