    "seller_description": "This electric kettle features a classic mirror-polished design that adds a unique and aesthetic touch to any kitchen while complementing various styles. Its 360° swivel base with a standard power cord ensures safe usage and convenient storage. The cordless pouring design allows the kettle to be easily lifted from its base for filling or serving and can be returned from any direction, making it ideal for both right and left-handed users. BPA-free and visually striking, it is perfect for preparing and serving, with easy storage. Powered by a 1500W concealed heating element, it boils up to 1.5 liters of water in just 5 to 7 minutes, offering a quicker and safer option for your hot beverages. Maintenance is simple with white vinegar, baking soda, and a microfiber cloth to keep it clean and new-looking. Note: This kettle does not feature a water level indicator.",
    "review": "Poor quality, built quality is also very poor, rust is already seen in the kettle in just 1 use.",
    "expected_output": "The seller's image depicts an electric kettle with a polished mirror finish, sleek design, and a black handle, aligning with the description of a visually striking and aesthetic appliance. The buyer's image, however, shows signs of rust forming inside the kettle after just one use, which is a clear discrepancy from the seller's claims of durability and easy maintenance. The seller's description highlights the kettle's BPA-free design, 360° swivel base, quick boiling capability, and ease of cleaning, suggesting a premium quality product suitable for daily use. However, the buyer's review explicitly points out poor build quality and the appearance of rust, which contradicts the seller's assertion of a durable and well-maintained appliance. Based on the buyer's experience and the visible evidence, the dissatisfaction stems from the product's inability to meet the promised standards. The fault lies with the seller, as the product does not align with the advertised features or the expectations set by the description and images.",
