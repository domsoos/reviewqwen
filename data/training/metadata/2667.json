    "review": "One of the figurines had a chipped base, making it unstable and not usable as decor.",
    "Expected-output": "The seller's description and images emphasize the durability and decorative utility of the figurines. The buyer's image highlights a physical defect (chipped base), which contradicts the promised quality. The seller is at fault for not ensuring proper quality control.",
