    "review": "I bought this, then started a kitchen remodel and had it stored in the box. Now that i am able to use it, it only worked a few times then it stopped. I changed the battery and it would spin but if i put it in the creamer, it stops as if its not powerful enough to stir it. It eventually stopped all together. Bummer.",
    "expected-output": "The New England Stories milk frother is advertised as a reliable tool designed to quickly create rich foam for various beverages. Key features highlighted by the seller include a high-speed stainless-steel whisk, an ergonomic and portable handle, easy cleaning, and versatility in usage for frothing milk, mixing matcha, protein shakes, and more. The product description emphasizes ease of use with a one-button operation, and it is marketed as a thoughtful gift for coffee enthusiasts. Additionally, the seller’s image clarifies the frother’s components, including the on/off button, handle, battery holder, and whisk, while noting that a stand is not included. The seller’s image presents the frother in a sleek, modern design, positioned upright, emphasizing its ergonomic structure. This aligns with the seller's claims of it being lightweight and portable. However, the buyer’s experience significantly diverges from the advertised promises. According to the buyer’s review, the frother initially worked but soon began to fail. After a few uses, the frother stopped working effectively, even after replacing the battery. The buyer reports that while it spins without resistance, it lacks the power to stir creamer or foam liquids, stopping whenever it encounters the liquid’s thickness. Eventually, the frother ceased working altogether, leaving the buyer disappointed. The buyer’s tone indicates dissatisfaction, especially as they only recently started using the product after a kitchen remodel. The provided image from the buyer shows the frother in a different color (pink), but it otherwise matches the design and structure shown in the seller’s images, confirming it is the same model. In conclusion, there appears to be a discrepancy between the seller's advertised durability and performance and the buyer's actual experience with the product. While the frother is promoted as powerful enough to create rich foam within seconds, the buyer’s review suggests it may lack the durability or motor strength to maintain this performance over time. The issue seems to be with the frother's motor power, which, as per the buyer’s account, was insufficient to handle thicker liquids, contrary to the versatility claimed by the seller. The buyer’s disappointment is valid, as the frother did not meet the durability and functionality expectations set by the seller’s description. This case highlights a potential gap in quality control or product consistency that may affect the frother’s reliability in long-term use.",
