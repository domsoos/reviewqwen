    "review": "Got myself a pair which disappeared onto the hands of my wife - even though they were large size. Gloves not her hands!So have ordered a second smaller pair for her.Nice fit. Comfortable. Non slip surface a bonus, particularly when using with electronics.Will keep the chill off your hands unless you live in Minnesota.Was surprised that the keypad touch fabric actually works. And works well.",
