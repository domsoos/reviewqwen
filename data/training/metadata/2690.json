    "review": "The zipper on the bag broke on the very first use, and the overall material feels flimsy. Completely disappointed!",
    "Expected-output": "The seller emphasizes the use of heavy-quality material and a durable design with a large double-zip compartment. The buyer's image shows a broken zipper, contradicting the durability claims in the seller's description. Although the external design aligns with the seller's images, the functional flaw points to a defect in manufacturing or material quality. The fault lies with the seller for not ensuring product functionality and quality.",
