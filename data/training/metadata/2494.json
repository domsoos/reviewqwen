    "review": "The desk riser is unstable and wobbles when used at maximum height. This makes it unsafe for holding monitors securely.",
    "Expected-output": "The seller claims the riser combines stability with a sleek design. Buyer images and reviews highlight instability, especially at higher adjustments, which negates the promised stability. The seller is accountable for not ensuring product sturdiness at all heights.",
