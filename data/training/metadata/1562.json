    "review": "This food is so bad that both of my dogs have not stopped vomiting since they ate this food, this is a crappy product.",
    "expected-output": "The seller markets Purepet Adult Dog Food as a balanced, nutrient-rich, and easily digestible option to promote health and vitality in dogs. However, the buyer had a highly negative experience, reporting that both of their dogs vomited continuously after consuming the product, contradicting the seller's claims of easy digestion and health benefits. This raises concerns about potential quality or formulation issues, resulting in a dissatisfied customer who strongly criticized the product.",
