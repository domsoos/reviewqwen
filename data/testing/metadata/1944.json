    "review": "Overall the quality of bag is good stitching is strong and zip are okay quality and the most important thing it is not waterproof neither water-resistant.",
    "expected-output": "The buyer's review highlights that the bag's quality is good, with strong stitching and decent zippers, which aligns with the seller's description of a durable backpack. However, the buyer mentions that the bag is neither waterproof nor water-resistant, which directly contradicts the seller's claim of a waterproof design and rain cover. This indicates a discrepancy between the seller's description and the buyer's experience. The fault appears to lie with the seller's inaccurate description regarding the waterproof features of the bag.",
