    "expected-output":"The seller’s description accurately covers the shoe’s comfort and durability, citing a soft cushion insole, mesh for breathability, and reinforced stitching for longevity. The buyer’s own experience confirms that the footwear is indeed comfortable and lightweight, fulfilling the main promises of the seller. However, there is a clear visual mismatch between the color shown in the seller’s image and what the buyer received. While this discrepancy doesn’t affect the buyer’s satisfaction with the shoe’s performance, it indicates the seller provided a product inconsistent with the advertised design.",
