    "review": "So cute and retro. I put them in my bedroom ceiling fan, although they might be a tad too bright for that. The good news is that my husband will never ever complain again about not being able to find things in there, so I'll probably leave them. They're not dimmable, so if that's what you're looking for don't order these. But if you're looking for a very stylish bulb that's incredibly bright, these bulbs are the way to go!By the way, kudos to the manufacturer or packager because as you can see in the pictures they come really well packaged. You're not going to get any broken bulbs unless there's a disaster with your delivery box.",
