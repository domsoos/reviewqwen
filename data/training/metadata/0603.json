    "review": "Box delivered completely damaged and retaped like it had been opened and sent me someone else's returned one, when I had paid and purchased for a new one. Heating element only warmed up when turned on all the way high. Have yet to cook on it, so no comment on that yet.",
    "expected-output": "The seller, Elite Gourmet, describes this indoor electric grill as a high-quality appliance designed to replicate the outdoor grilling experience within the convenience of home. Key features include a large 14-inch non-stick cooking surface, a powerful 1300W circular heating element for even cooking, and adjustable thermostat controls with five heat settings up to 450\u00b0F. The grill also includes a drip tray to collect excess fat, a dishwasher-safe design for easy cleaning, and a cool-touch base and handles for safe handling. Additionally, the seller emphasizes the product\u2019s durability and includes a one-year warranty, highlighting that the grill is intended to deliver convenience, safety, and performance. The seller\u2019s images depict a clean, undamaged grill with a variety of foods cooking evenly, reinforcing the image of a well-crafted product that meets the advertised standards. In contrast, the buyer\u2019s experience appears to deviate significantly from the seller's claims. According to the buyer, the product arrived in a damaged box that had been re-taped, suggesting the possibility of receiving a previously opened or returned item rather than a new product as expected. The buyer\u2019s images support this claim, showing visible damage to the box. This experience likely affected the buyer\u2019s perception of quality and reliability, as they had anticipated a new, pristine product. Furthermore, the buyer reports an issue with the grill\u2019s heating performance, noting that the heating element only warmed up when the control was set to the highest setting. This could indicate a defect in the temperature control mechanism, which conflicts with the seller\u2019s promise of efficient and adjustable heating. While the buyer has not yet attempted to cook on the grill, this initial experience with the heating element raises concerns about the product's functionality and overall quality. In this case, the buyer\u2019s dissatisfaction seems rooted in both the condition of the product upon arrival and a possible defect in its heating mechanism. The discrepancy between the seller\u2019s description and the buyer\u2019s experience suggests potential quality control or packaging issues. The damaged box and retaped packaging indicate that the product may have been mishandled or returned by a previous customer, leading the buyer to question whether they received a used or refurbished item rather than a new one. In conclusion, the buyer\u2019s experience highlights a gap between the seller\u2019s promises and the reality of the product received. While the seller emphasizes quality, performance, and customer satisfaction, the damaged packaging and potential heating issues have led to the buyer\u2019s dissatisfaction and distrust. This situation underscores the importance of ensuring that products are carefully inspected and securely packaged before shipping, as well as verifying functionality to meet customer expectations. The buyer's concerns are valid and primarily arise from a mismatch between the advertised condition and performance of the grill and what they actually received. The seller appears to be at fault here. The buyer\u2019s dissatisfaction stems from receiving the product in a damaged box that appeared re-taped, possibly indicating a returned or mishandled item. Additionally, the reported heating issue deviates from the seller\u2019s promise of efficient and adjustable temperature controls. This gap between the advertised quality and the product received suggests potential quality control or packaging issues on the seller's part, justifying the buyer\u2019s concerns.",
