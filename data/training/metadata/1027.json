    "review": "Bad quality product..., look for something else",
    "expected-output": "The seller's description presents a backpack as stylish and functional with safety features, a soft mesh back with foam padding for comfort, two main compartments, an internal slip-in pocket for organization, a printed design for style, and a mesh bottle holder on the side, noting it is not water-resistant with dimensions specified. The seller\u2019s image showcases a black backpack aligning with these features, emphasizing practicality and aesthetics. The buyer\u2019s image, however, depicts a blue backpack that significantly differs in color and design from the seller's representation, suggesting a possible discrepancy. The buyer's review explicitly indicates dissatisfaction, describing the product as bad quality and recommending others to look elsewhere. Based on the analysis, the buyer's dissatisfaction appears justified due to a mismatch between the seller's description and the product received, highlighting a fault on the seller's part for not delivering the promised product as described. This lack of alignment between the visual and descriptive elements provided by the seller and the buyer's experience is the primary cause of the negative feedback.",
