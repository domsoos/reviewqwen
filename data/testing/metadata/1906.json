    "review": "Very thin material and stitches on both the ends of bag are not reliable, dimentions are appropriate for all sizes of footwear",
    "expected-output": "The images provided by both the seller and the buyer depict the same type of shoe bag, featuring a simple design with a transparent window and a drawstring closure. The seller's description promises a dustproof, odorless, stain-resistant, and breathable material, emphasizing the bag's ability to keep shoes organized and protected during travel, with dimensions suitable for a variety of footwear. The seller also mentions that the bags can be used for items beyond shoes, such as shirts, sports gear, and other travel essentials. The buyer's review, however, expresses dissatisfaction with the thin material and unreliable stitching, despite acknowledging that the dimensions of the bag are appropriate for all shoe sizes. The discrepancy lies in the perceived quality of the material and stitching, which the buyer feels does not meet expectations, even though the seller's description emphasized durability and protection. The buyer seems to be dissatisfied due to the construction quality, which may suggest that the issue could lie with either the batch quality or an individual product defect, rather than an overall fault with the seller's claims.",
