    "review": "I\u2019ve been using the Tree Hut Vitamin C Shea Sugar Scrub, and it\u2019s officially my favorite body exfoliator! Here\u2019s what makes it stand out:1. Exfoliates Effectively: This scrub is fantastic for getting rid of dead skin. The sugar crystals are just the right size to provide deep exfoliation without being too harsh.

Even after exfoliating, I don\u2019t feel like I need to immediately apply lotion.3. Vitamin C Brightening Power: The addition of vitamin C is a huge bonus! Over time, I\u2019ve noticed that my skin looks brighter and more even-toned. It\u2019s great for targeting areas of dullness, especially on my legs and arms.4. Refreshing Scent: The scent is light and fresh, with a hint of citrus from the vitamin C. It\u2019s not overwhelming but leaves a subtle fragrance on your skin that\u2019s pleasant and energizing.5. Easy to Apply: The scrub has a thick, rich consistency, making it easy to scoop and apply without it slipping out of your hands. It stays put on the skin while exfoliating, and rinsing it off is easy too, without leaving any residue.6. Value for Money: For 18 oz, this scrub is a great value. A little goes a long way, so it lasts a while even if you use it regularly.7. Vegan & Cruelty-Free: It\u2019s great to know this product is vegan and cruelty-free, so I can feel good about the ingredients and ethical practices behind it.Overall: If you\u2019re looking for an affordable, effective, and hydrating body scrub with skin-brightening benefits, the Tree Hut Vitamin C Shea Sugar Scrub is a fantastic choice. It has improved both the look and feel of my skin, making it a staple in my body care routine",
