    "review": "I couldn\u2019t pair these earbuds with my old MP3 player. It\u2019s frustrating that they are not compatible with such devices.",
    "Expected-output": "The buyer\u2019s dissatisfaction arises from an expectation that the earbuds should work with an older MP3 player. The seller\u2019s description and images emphasize modern wireless functionality but do not mention compatibility with legacy devices. The fault lies with the buyer for assuming unsupported compatibility.",
