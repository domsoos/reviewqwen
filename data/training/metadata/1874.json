    "review": "I have ordered 200 pcs one pakage was okay and second one pouches were not good it's bottom corner was not properly sealed....need to improve quality and thickness of pouch",
    "expected-output": "The seller describes the polybags as durable, self-adhesive, tear-resistant, waterproof, and available in different pack sizes, with each bag measuring 8 inches by 10 inches. The buyer mentions receiving a pack of 200 bags, but one of the packages had bags with poorly sealed bottom corners, indicating a quality control issue. The buyer suggests improving the quality and thickness of the pouches. The fault lies with the seller for not ensuring consistent quality in the product's manufacturing process.",
