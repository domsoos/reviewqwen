    "review": "The bag arrived with a torn strap and scratches on the leatherette surface, making it look old and used. Definitely not what I expected for the price!",
    "Expected-output": "Based on the seller's description and images, the bag is promoted as a premium product made of leatherette with a robust and stylish design. The buyer's image reveals a torn strap and noticeable scratches, which contradict the seller's claims of rigorous quality checks and durability. While the advertised design and features like adjustable handles and spacious compartments match the product's promise, the damage suggests a lack of quality assurance or mishandling during delivery. Here, the seller is at fault for delivering a defective product.",
