    "review": "The tracker didn\u2019t live up to the promised 350-foot Bluetooth range. I could barely connect within 100 feet, making it unreliable for finding my misplaced items. Disappointing performance overall.",
    "Expected-output": "The seller's description promises a reliable Bluetooth range of 350 feet for the Tile tracker, but the buyer's experience highlights a significant limitation, with connectivity issues at shorter distances. This discrepancy suggests a failure in the advertised functionality, and the seller is at fault for overpromising and underdelivering.",
