    "expected-output": "The buyer expresses overall satisfaction with the Cajon, highlighting its suitability for beginners and music lovers, along with its value for money. The buyer praises the sound clarity and bass, which aligns with the seller’s description emphasizing the Cajon’s range of sounds and tonal qualities, such as crisp snares and deep bass. Additionally, the buyer appreciates the packaging, which the seller did not specifically mention but could be seen as a positive aspect of the purchase. However, the buyer notes a small scratch on the left top corner of the Cajon, which did not significantly affect their enjoyment of the product. The scratch, though mentioned as a minor issue, does not appear to detract from the buyer’s satisfaction overall. The product in the buyer’s image matches the seller's image, with no visible discrepancies in the appearance or features. In conclusion, the buyer is largely satisfied with the product, enjoying its sound quality and functionality, and the scratch appears to be a minor cosmetic flaw that does not diminish the product's performance or value. The fault lies with the seller for the minor scratch, which may have occurred during handling or shipping, but the buyer did not let this small issue impact their overall positive experience. The seller is not entirely at fault since the product works as described and meets the buyer's needs, although better quality control during packaging could have prevented the minor scratch.",
