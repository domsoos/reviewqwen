    "expected-output": "Seller's Description Analysis The seller describes the Resistance Tubes as made from 100% latex and available in four strength levels (Light, Medium, Heavy, and X-Heavy), catering to both beginners and experienced athletes. Ideal for home gyms, they mimic the muscle engagement of weights and enhance workouts, including glute and hip activation, and integrate well with Yoga and Pilates. The tubes are suitable for targeting all major muscle groups, such as arms, chest, abdomen, glutes, and legs, and are recommended for physical therapy, recovery, and mobility improvement. Using the tubes for 15-20 minutes daily ensures consistent progress toward fitness goals. Buyer's Review Analysis The buyer\u2019s review does not seem to express any satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the Resistance Tubes directly. Instead, the buyer has made a request to the seller: Please change the size so give 1kg size. The buyer is asking for a 1kg size, which suggests a potential misunderstanding about the product, as the tubes are sold by resistance levels (Light, Medium, Heavy, X-Heavy) and not by weight. Analysis of the Images Buyer\u2019s Image: The image does not seem to show any issue or problem related to the size request. Seller\u2019s Image: The seller's image likely shows the product in its original form as intended by the manufacturer. Discrepancies Identified Size Request: The buyer is requesting a 1kg size, but the Resistance Tubes are marketed based on strength levels rather than weight. The request seems to misunderstand how the tubes are sold. Product Use vs. Request: The buyer\u2019s request does not align with the product\u2019s actual design and intended use (strength levels vs. weight). Conclusion The buyer seems to have misunderstood the product specifications, as the Resistance Tubes are not sold by weight (1kg size). Instead, they are sold by strength levels. The buyer may need clarification on how to select the appropriate resistance level for their fitness needs.",
