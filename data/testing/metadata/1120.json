    "review": "Came in box, gift wrapped, looks ok. Not good enough for the price. Cushions are not velvet. It looks cheap. Quality & price doesn’t match.Will update its durability",
    "expected-output": " Upon comparing the seller’s description, which highlights fine velvet interiors, premium PU leather exteriors, and an elegant presentation, with the buyer’s review stating that the watch box “looks cheap” and the cushions “are not velvet,” a discrepancy arises regarding the product’s advertised quality. The buyer further remarks that the box is “not good enough for the price,” suggesting dissatisfaction with how the quality matches its cost. While the buyer indicates it came gift-wrapped and plans to assess durability over time, the primary concern is that the product’s actual materials and perceived quality do not align with the seller’s stated claims. Therefore, the seller appears to be at fault for not meeting expectations set by the product description, as the buyer’s criticism focuses on the mismatch between advertised premium features and the reality of the received item.",
