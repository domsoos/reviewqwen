    "review": "Not worth... Vegetables got dried..",
    "expected-output": "The buyer's review expresses dissatisfaction with the eco-friendly kitchen grocery bags, particularly due to the fact that the vegetables dried out, which goes against the seller's claim that the bags are breathable and prevent vegetable rot by allowing ethylene gas to escape. The seller's description highlights these same benefits, suggesting that the bags should help maintain the freshness of stored produce. However, the buyer's experience contradicts this claim, indicating a potential mismatch between the product's intended functionality and its actual performance. The buyer appears dissatisfied with the product's performance, and it seems the fault may lie in the product's ability to maintain produce freshness as promised, suggesting the seller's description may need clarification or improvement in terms of functionality.",
