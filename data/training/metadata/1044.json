    "review": "Useful for getting idea of TDS of water you consume......however precision is not satisfied.",
    "expected-output": "The provided Konvio Neer TDS meter, as depicted in the seller’s images, aligns with the visual appearance of the product received by the buyer. The seller’s description highlights features such as an intelligent detection chip, fast and accurate readings, auto shut-off functionality, and its versatility for various applications, including testing drinking water and aquariums. The buyer’s review acknowledges the utility of the product in providing an idea of the TDS levels in water, which is consistent with the seller’s claims. However, the buyer expresses dissatisfaction with the precision of the readings, indicating that while the product fulfills its basic purpose, it does not meet expectations for accuracy. This discrepancy suggests that while the product functions as advertised, its precision may not match the implied standards in the seller's description. The fault here lies with the seller for potentially overpromising on the product’s accuracy without clearly setting expectations regarding its limitations.",
