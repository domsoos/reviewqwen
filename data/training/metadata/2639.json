    "review": "The packaging was plain and didn\u2019t look premium enough for a OnePlus product. It lacked the wow factor.",
    "Expected-output": "The buyer is dissatisfied with the packaging aesthetics, which is not a feature described or emphasized in the seller\u2019s description or images. The product itself performs as described, and the review reflects a personal preference for packaging rather than a fault with the product or seller.",
