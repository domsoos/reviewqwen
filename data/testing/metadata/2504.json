    "review": "These glasses are quite uncomfortable for long wear. The arms press against my temples, and the lightweight claim feels misleading as they feel heavy after a while.",
    "Expected-output": "The seller's description highlights lightweight comfort for all-day wear, but the buyer's experience contradicts this claim. The product does not meet the advertised comfort standard, making the seller responsible for the mismatch.",
