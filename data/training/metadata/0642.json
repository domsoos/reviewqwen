    "expected-output": "Seller’s Description: The seller promotes the \"ZAP IT!\" electric bug zapper racket as a powerful, portable, and reliable tool for eliminating insects. It promises a 4,000-volt grid that can kill pests instantly and advertises a super-bright built-in LED for nighttime use. The product claims to be ergonomically designed for comfort, easy to use, and safe, featuring a triple-layer safety mesh. The seller also mentions a durable lithium battery capable of supporting up to 10,000 zaps on a single charge, highlighting its efficiency and portability. Buyer’s Review: The buyer expressed significant dissatisfaction with the product, citing that neither of the two rackets they received functioned as expected. One unit would not power on, and the other exhibited a defect causing the plastic frame to melt due to an internal short. The buyer’s review and attached images show signs of issues that contradict the seller’s claims of reliability and durability, particularly concerning safety and functionality. Visual Evidence: In the buyer's image, the racket’s yellow frame shows visible damage that aligns with the buyer's complaint of melting plastic due to a short. This defect questions the product’s advertised durability and safety features. The buyer’s image of the melted frame directly contrasts the seller’s images of a robust and functional device intended to handle frequent usage without compromise. Discrepancy and Conclusion: The seller’s promise of a reliable, powerful, and safe product is not reflected in the buyer’s experience. The defect in the buyer’s unit — specifically the melting frame and malfunctioning power — suggests a quality control or manufacturing issue. The reliability of the product is questionable, given the buyer received two faulty units in a single purchase. The discrepancies in the product's quality, as observed by the buyer, do not align with the seller's portrayal of the zapper's durability and high functionality. Conclusion: The buyer is dissatisfied with the product due to critical functional issues that undermine the seller's assurances of quality and safety. This dissatisfaction is justified as the product’s defects prevented it from working as advertised, ultimately leading to a poor user experience. The fault here lies with the seller’s product quality, as the buyer’s experience indicates defects that should have been addressed during manufacturing or quality control. The fault lies with the seller in this case. The buyer's experience indicates significant quality issues with the product, including one unit not powering on and another suffering from a malfunction that caused the plastic frame to melt. These defects contradict the seller's claims of reliability, durability, and safety. Given the nature of the defects, it suggests a manufacturing or quality control issue. The product did not perform as advertised, leading to justified dissatisfaction from the buyer. Therefore, the seller is at fault for not ensuring the product's quality and functionality before shipping.",
