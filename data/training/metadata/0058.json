    "review": "My roller stopped spinning after only three uses. Was working fine until the third use. I cleaned it out   charged it, still no luck, so unscrewed the two small screws beneath the roller head and turns out one of the gears below (can see 3) is completely stripped. Leaving the top gear/wheel unable to spin. Sooooo bummed because I really liked this product up until this happened. Annnnnd, my return window is of course closed.",
    "expected-output": "Seller’s Description vs. Buyer’s Experience: The seller markets the PRITECH Electric Callus Remover as an efficient and rechargeable foot care tool designed to remove calluses and dead skin quickly and safely. It is advertised as waterproof with two-speed settings and multiple rollers for varying roughness levels. The product is described as being easy to use and clean, with a rechargeable battery offering up to 45 minutes of runtime. The seller emphasizes durability and high performance, ideal for personal foot care. The buyer’s review, however, reveals a significant issue with the product’s durability. The roller stopped functioning after only three uses, and upon inspection, the buyer discovered that one of the internal gears was stripped, rendering the product inoperable. This defect contradicts the seller’s promises of durability and high-quality performance, especially after such limited use. The buyer is disappointed, particularly because the product initially performed well, but is now unusable due to the mechanical failure. The buyer’s dissatisfaction stems from a quality control issue with the product’s internal components, which are critical for its functionality. This issue raises concerns about the product’s long-term reliability, which is a central promise made by the seller. Although the product’s design and concept are appealing, the mechanical failure of the gear undermines the overall user experience. In conclusion, the buyer’s experience reveals a discrepancy between the seller’s claims of durability and the actual performance of the product. The gear failure, especially so early in use, highlights a potential issue with the product’s quality control. While the product might be effective initially, the mechanical failure after limited use suggests inconsistency in manufacturing. The fault lies with the seller or manufacturer, as the product failed due to a mechanical defect after minimal use. This issue contradicts the seller’s claims of durability and high performance, making it clear that the product did not meet the advertised standards. The buyer's frustration is justified, and the quality control issue with the internal components is a significant concern.\"",
