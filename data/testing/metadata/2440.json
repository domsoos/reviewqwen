But I wanted to make sure everything worked correctly and wasn't broken when I received it, so I plugged it up in my kitchen. After having it turned on for literally 1 minute, the room just felt warm (not hot) and homey. it kind of freaks me out how calming and relaxing the energy from this lamp makes me feel lol. Beautiful, natural, pretty, warm glow! just arrived today, and so far, I'm finding it beautiful. As to appearance, it's lovely, and soothing. The dimmer switch allows for a few different settings to adjust how bright you'd like it to go. I just turned it on and it's sitting nearby, with quite wonderful glow. The best gift you'll ever give! I fell in love with this lamp after seen it in a magazine and have given it as a Christmas, and a just because gift and it is a hit every time. A beautiful lamp I was a little concerned about the leakage that people seemed to be reporting. This seems to be a natural result of the salt lamp, depending on its environment. Though my room isn't humid during the winter. A must for my stuffy apartment. this lamp spends all night dimmed on my bedside table. I've really appreciated the soft light in the room, and I've noticed a difference in air quality. It seems to be solidly built. I've owned this lamp since August 2016, and it still looks new out of the box. Thank you very much for your time! what is in the boxes x 15-watt light bulb 1 x Himalayan salt night lamp with dimmable switch. 1 x user manual of salt lamp ",
    "review": "I love this Himalayan salt lamp so very much I have 5 in my apartment. 2 in bedroom and 3 in living room. I bought 2 as gifts this year and 2 as gifts last Christmas. I never turn them off. They are bright so I adjust brightness at night and use them as night lights. They add an incredible ambiance to a room. Great value for money and will buy one for my bathroom and kitchen. I don\u2019t think I could have too many.Update: I have added another lamp to my living space, and the salt lamp diffuser to to my kitchen counter.I just ordered one for my bathroom.Very happy with these salt lamps.I bought 2 as Christmas gifts.I live in Texas and because of the humidity and the length of time in the delivery trucks they start melting. One was do badly damages there was a hole and the bulb was visible. I contacted the seller, they said they would replace it, buy never did. I have tried calling seven times, I think they recognized my number and send it to to voicemail because they have change their minds about replacement it.The lamps are great, I am happy with them, but the seller \u2026 not so much.\u200b",
    "Expected_output": "The provided seller description highlights the aesthetic appeal and functional features of the Himalayan salt lamp, emphasizing its handcrafted uniqueness, natural Himalayan rock salt material, Neem wood base, and dimmable 15-watt light bulb with UL-certified components. The accompanying seller image showcases a warm amber glow in a polished, visually refined presentation. The buyer\u2019s image, while capturing a similar natural glow, depicts a lamp with less polished edges, consistent with its handcrafted nature, but diverging slightly from the pristine finish suggested in the seller's image. The buyer\u2019s review expresses overall satisfaction, appreciating the lamp\u2019s calming ambiance, functional dimmer switch, and suitability as a decorative and atmospheric addition to their home. However, the buyer mentions dissatisfaction with the seller's lack of response to replace a damaged lamp caused by delivery conditions, highlighting a discrepancy in customer service promises. While the product aligns with the seller's description in terms of functionality and appearance, the customer service failure lies at the seller's fault. The buyer is ultimately satisfied with the product itself but disappointed in the post-purchase support, resulting in a mixed experience.",
