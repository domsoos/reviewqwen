    "review": "This helmet is great. Reading a few mixed reviews I was hesitant to purchase it. But when it came up on prime days and it checked all my boxes I decided to try it. My biggest concern was weight. Having broke my neck several years back I simple can't wear a 5lb helmet. Especially in the wind. This 1 came in around 3lbs. It's great. Even with the light weight it still feels like it's built well enough to protect my head in a crash. The padding is removable and washable and is reasonably comfortable. I have not wore a helmet in years as it isn't required in my state. The tinted shield appears very dark from the outside. It's not from the inside. More similar to a smoke. The shield also is what the manufacturer calls HD. I'm not positive what it's coated with but it reminds me of polarized glasses. It's amazingly crisp and clear. Came with 2 shields tinted and clear. I have not tried the clear. It also came with a zip in scarf that I'm not sure I'll use. But I was able to zip it off and the zipper does not get in the way at all. Doesn't touch you anywhere. You really don't notice it at all. I also found sizing to be pretty good. My head measurement was 23 inches even. That put me larger than a medium and smaller than a large. I have ears I didn't want to rip off everytime I put the helmet on or off so I ordered the large. It fits perfect. Snug enough it's not sloppy but it doesn't try to remove any body parts. The only thing really close to negative I can say is I was hoping it'd be a quieter inside the helmet. Maybe if I had went with the medium it would fit tighter making less wind noise. But for all I know ever helmet could be equally as loud so you will have to determine that on your own",
    "Expected_output": "The ILM Motorcycle Helmet appears to deliver on the promises outlined in the seller's description. The buyer's images show a product visually consistent with the seller's photos, featuring the streamlined, aerodynamic design, and included visors. The seller's claims of lightweight construction are supported by the buyer's review, which praises the helmet's weight, essential for comfort, particularly for someone with prior neck injuries. The inclusion of both clear and tinted visors aligns with the description, and the buyer highlights the clarity of the tinted visor, comparing it favorably to polarized glasses. The removable, washable padding and the zip-in scarf are also mentioned positively, further affirming the product's advertised versatility. The only slight deviation noted by the buyer is wind noise, which may depend on fit or external conditions. This minor point doesn't reflect dissatisfaction but a personal observation. Overall, the buyer expresses satisfaction with the product, indicating that it meets their needs for safety, comfort, and functionality. There are no significant discrepancies, and the buyer's positive review confirms that the seller's product and description align well. Here, no fault lies with either party as the expectations were met satisfactorily."
