    "expected-output": " The seller presents the Boldfit NBR Yoga Mat as a premium, durable, and comfortable product, emphasizing its 8mm thick cushioning, non-slip surfaces, and long-lasting quality, making it suitable for various workouts. However, the buyer's review indicates disappointment due to receiving a damaged product, expressing doubts about its durability and unsure whether the fault lies with the seller or delivery process. While the mat's softness is appreciated, the damage contradicts the seller's claims of high quality and durability. This discrepancy suggests a need for the seller to improve quality control and packaging to prevent such issues, as the fault cannot be definitively assigned based on the provided information.",
