    "review": "I ordered this since it was little higher in price and thought quality would be above average but it turned out to be poor quality and after using for 10 times while removing the gloves it got torn. No use of lining straps placed in between fingers, it won't help easy removal at all.",

The gloves tore after only 10 uses: The issue specifically arises when the buyer removed the gloves, suggesting a potential weakness in the material or stitching. 'No use of lining straps placed in between fingers': The lining straps intended for easy removal did not serve their purpose, further contributing to the negative experience.

The gloves tore during removal, and the lining straps didn’t help with easy removal as intended.
