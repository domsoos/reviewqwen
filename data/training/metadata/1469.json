    "expected-output": "The seller advertises the Sparx Sports Shoes as a high-quality product with a durable mesh upper, EVA sole, and elegant packaging, reflecting the brand’s assurance of quality and performance. The description emphasizes longevity and suitability for active wear, packaged attractively for gifting purposes. However, the buyer's review indicates dissatisfaction due to a scratch issue on one side of the shoe. This discrepancy directly contradicts the seller's promise of a zero-compromise product. The issue is specific to the delivered product's quality, suggesting inadequate quality control or oversight in the packaging or manufacturing process. The buyer’s dissatisfaction is valid, as the defect undermines the advertised standards of quality and performance. The fault lies with the seller for not ensuring that the product delivered matches the described condition.",
