    "review": "The motor overheats and shuts down after a single blending session, making it inconvenient for daily use.",
    "Expected-output": "The seller's description assures a robust motor capable of quick and efficient blending, as demonstrated in the seller's images. However, the buyer's complaint about overheating and shutdown issues indicates a significant flaw in the product's performance. This failure undermines the seller's claims of reliability and convenience, attributing the fault to the seller for providing a subpar product.",
