    "review": "I bought this burner for my apartment and was expecting a new product. However, what I received looked like it had been previously used and was in poor condition. The product had scratches, stains, and the coil was already showing signs of wear. I was really disappointed since it wasn\u00e2 t mentioned anywhere that it was a used or refurbished item. I feel misled by the description and would not have bought it had I known it was not new.",
    "expected-output": "Seller's Description: The seller markets this electric burner as a compact, portable, and reliable cooking appliance with adjustable temperature settings, ideal for use in small spaces, such as offices or outdoor environments. It emphasizes features like non-slip rubber feet, a power indicator light, and a slim, space-saving design. Buyer\u2019s Experience: The buyer, however, expresses dissatisfaction with the condition of the product upon arrival. They ordered the burner expecting a new product, but received one that appeared to be used, with visible signs of wear and tear. The buyer highlights that no mention of the product being used or refurbished was made, which created a negative experience. Discrepancies: The primary issue here is the condition of the product. While the seller advertises a new product, the buyer received one that was in poor, used condition. This discrepancy is significant as the buyer expected a new product and did not receive what was advertised. Conclusion: The buyer's dissatisfaction stems from receiving a product that was not as described, indicating that the fault lies with the seller. The product was marketed as new, but the buyer received a used item without prior notice. This lack of transparency regarding the product's condition led to the buyer's negative experience. Fault: The fault lies with the seller. The product description misrepresented the condition of the item, leading to the buyer's dissatisfaction. The seller should have clearly indicated if the product was refurbished or used.",
