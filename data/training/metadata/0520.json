    "expected-output": "Seller's Description Analysis: The seller describes this blouse as: Made of 95% Polyester and 5% Spandex, suggesting a lightweight, breathable fabric that is comfortable to wear. Features a solid color, flowy short sleeves, a split V-neckline, and Swiss dot fabric, which adds a textured style element. Promises that the top is versatile, can be dressed up or down, and is suitable for various occasions. Indicates that it has a relaxed fit, which some users might find comfortable and others may find loose or billowy. Machine washable with care instructions provided. Buyer's Review Analysis: The buyer reports dissatisfaction, stating: They bought the blouse as a gift, but when the recipient tried to wear it, there was already a large hole in the shoulder area. The buyer did not notice this defect initially, and the return window has closed, preventing any possibility of a return or exchange. Image Comparison and Discrepancies: Seller’s Image: The blouse looks stylish, well-constructed, and has a textured Swiss dot pattern, appearing as a comfortable and durable garment. Buyer’s Image: The buyer's photo shows a noticeable hole in the shoulder area, indicating a quality issue that contradicts the seller’s claim of high quality. Conclusion: The blouse does not meet the buyer’s expectations due to a quality defect (the hole in the shoulder area). This defect likely represents a manufacturing or quality control issue rather than a sizing or design issue. The defect has resulted in buyer dissatisfaction, particularly because it was meant to be a gift, and the flaw was only discovered after the return window had closed. \" The seller is at fault due to a quality control issue, as the blouse arrived with a noticeable defect (a hole in the shoulder area), which contradicts the seller's description of a well-constructed, durable product and led to buyer dissatisfaction.",
