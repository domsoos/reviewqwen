    "seller_description": "This wallet is crafted from top-grain buffalo leather, ensuring durability and a unique natural appearance, with slight color variations that enhance its authenticity. Unlike PU leather, which retains a shiny surface, genuine leather ages beautifully, becoming more attractive over time. Handmade by skilled artisans with tough stitching, this WildHorn wallet combines contemporary style, masculinity, and durability. Its slim, lightweight design pairs perfectly with jeans or a suit, offering both practicality and elegance for the modern man.",
    "review": "Quality is good. The color I ordered was brown, but I got black.",
    "expected_output": "The buyer's review highlights a discrepancy between the color of the wallet they received and the color they ordered. The seller's description clearly states that the wallet is available in various colors, crafted from durable buffalo leather, and designed to age beautifully. The seller's image and description suggest a quality product made from genuine leather, with an emphasis on its durability and stylish design. However, the buyer received a black wallet instead of the brown one they ordered. This indicates a mistake in the fulfillment process, possibly due to a mix-up in stock or packaging. The buyer is satisfied with the quality of the wallet but dissatisfied with receiving an incorrect color. In this case, the fault lies with the seller for sending the wrong color, which does not match the buyer's expectations based on the order.",
