    "seller_description": "This high-quality mini keyboard features 120 voices (including 8 Indian voices) and 114 auto-accompaniment styles, along with the Smart Chord function, which includes 10 Indian styles for a rich and versatile playing experience. It also comes with 30 onboard songs, perfect for practice and performance, and includes a free digital songbook to enhance your musical journey.",
    "review": "It is simply waste of money . It doesn’t produce good sound quality for Indian instruments. Amazon is not even replacing it if you want to return or replace.",
    "expected-output": "The buyer expresses significant dissatisfaction with the mini keyboard, claiming it produces poor sound quality, particularly for Indian instruments, and mentions difficulty in returning or replacing the item through Amazon. This complaint contrasts with the seller's description, which highlights the keyboard's versatility, including its 8 Indian voices and 10 Indian styles, meant to provide a rich playing experience. The visual representation of the product in both the seller’s and buyer’s images appears consistent, indicating no discrepancy in the product’s physical appearance. The buyer’s dissatisfaction seems to be rooted in the perceived poor sound quality for Indian instruments, which might be a subjective evaluation, or it could reflect limitations in the keyboard's sound synthesis capabilities. However, the buyer's frustration with the return process points to potential service issues with Amazon rather than the seller directly. While the seller’s description is accurate in listing the features, the buyer’s experience with sound quality may not meet their expectations, suggesting a mismatch between the buyer’s needs and the product's capabilities. The fault here lies more with the buyer’s unmet expectations regarding sound quality for Indian instruments, as the product does offer the promised features. If the sound quality issue is a general limitation of the keyboard, then the buyer’s expectations may have been too high based on the description, but if the sound is indeed subpar, the seller’s product may not fully deliver on its promises.",
