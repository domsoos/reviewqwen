    "review": "Can't take any weight",
    "expected-output": "Product Appearance and Design: The seller\u2019s image depicts a set of hanging shelves with a modern, minimalist aesthetic. They are designed to be suspended using natural fiber ropes with hooks, creating a versatile and stylish addition to various interior spaces. The buyer\u2019s images showcase the actual product after installation. The shelf is similar in design to what is shown in the seller\u2019s image, with a triangular arrangement supported by ropes. However, the buyer\u2019s images display a simpler setup with fewer items, suggesting the shelf is perhaps lighter in build than expected. Product Description vs. Functionality: The seller claims the product is made from \u201ctop-grade MDF\u201d and \u201cnatural fiber ropes,\u201d which provide \u201cstrength and a beautiful natural texture.\u201d The description implies the product\u2019s durability and ability to handle certain weights by promoting its use for items like books, plants, and decorative pieces. The buyer, however, expresses dissatisfaction with the shelf\u2019s ability to bear weight, stating, \u201cCan't take any weight.\u201d This feedback highlights a significant discrepancy between the seller\u2019s implied promises and the actual functionality experienced by the buyer. The buyer\u2019s comment suggests that the shelf may be structurally weaker than advertised, which limits its usefulness for holding even modestly heavy items. Quality and Durability: The seller emphasizes the high quality of materials, presenting the product as durable and sustainable, fit for displaying a variety of household items. The buyer\u2019s review directly contradicts this claim, indicating that the shelf cannot support weight adequately, which raises concerns about its durability and stability for practical usage. This suggests that either the material quality does not meet the implied standard, or the design lacks the necessary structural support for heavier objects. Ease of Installation: The seller describes the product as \u201ceasy-to-install,\u201d with \u201chooks and wall anchors\u201d included to streamline the process. The buyer does not mention any issues with installation, which implies that the product may indeed be straightforward to mount as promised. Overall Satisfaction: Based on the review, it is clear that the buyer is dissatisfied with the product\u2019s performance, specifically its inability to hold weight. The seller\u2019s description creates an expectation of a sturdy, reliable shelf, which the buyer found to be untrue. Conclusion: There is a notable misalignment between the seller\u2019s description and the buyer\u2019s experience. The seller\u2019s description implies that the shelves are sturdy and capable of holding various items, while the buyer\u2019s feedback suggests that the product is unsuitable for holding weight. This discrepancy likely stems from either an overstatement of the product\u2019s capacity by the seller or a manufacturing issue affecting the shelf\u2019s strength. At Fault: The fault lies primarily with the seller for not accurately managing expectations regarding the product\u2019s weight-bearing capacity. The description should more clearly specify the shelf's limitations regarding weight support to ensure buyers have a realistic understanding of its functionality.",
