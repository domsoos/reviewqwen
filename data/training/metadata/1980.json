    "review": "All is good but some scratches in the product but it's ok",
    "expected-output": "The buyer's review indicates that, while the product met most expectations, there were some scratches present. The seller's description emphasizes the suitcase's features, such as ample space, secure 3-digit lock, and smooth maneuverability, which were likely appreciated by the buyer. However, the mention of scratches suggests a discrepancy in the quality of the product, which could have been due to packaging or shipping issues. The buyer accepts the scratches, indicating minor dissatisfaction, but overall the product is considered satisfactory. The seller's product generally meets the buyer's needs, but the issue of the scratches points to a slight fault, potentially in packaging or handling. The buyer is mostly satisfied but notes the imperfection.",
