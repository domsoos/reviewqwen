    "seller_description": "Finding foods with lots of nutrients can be helpful for people who are trying to change their diet and live a better life. The word \u201cchia\u201d comes from the ancient Mayan word for strength. Why would the Mayans use such a powerful word for such a small seed? Well, chia seeds are loaded with nutrients such as fiber and omega-3 fatty acids. Our Organic Chia Seeds are nutrient powerhouses which is why they deserve to be associated with strength. They contain 37% of the daily recommended value of fiber to help the 97% of Americans who are fiber deficient. Because our chia seeds are flavor neutral and flavorless, you can add them to just about anything to get a boost without changing the taste of your food. Just mix our chia seeds with your favorite breakfast shake, smoothie, bread batter, or other food that could use a little extra crunch that your family will love! Use them as a pre- or post-workout boost with protein powders that you are already using. You can also sprinkle the seeds as a topping on yogurt, salads, or cereal for a satisfying snack! Our Organic Chia Seeds can also be used as an egg replacement when cooking or baking. Simply mix 1 tbs. of chia seeds with 3 tbs. of water, let sit for 5 minutes, and consume or bake immediately. You can then use this mixture as a vegan substitute in your favorite recipes. These Organic Chia Seeds are gluten-free, vegan, nut-free, raw, low-carb, non-GMO, and paleo-friendly, making them the perfect powerhouse for your pantry. BetterBody Foods is determined to bring you quality products that are better for your body but that don\u2019t make you sacrifice the flavors that you enjoy. Find food that you\u2019ll love to love with our 2 lbs. bulk container of Organic Chia Seeds!",
