For added protection, it includes a velvet cover and a cardboard tube that doubles as a hard case.",
    "review": "This product doesn't work. I was on a travel when this was delivered. Upon me being back and checking it was already late for return. I'm at a loss now. How do I return this product.?",
    "expected-output": "The seller describes the C Natural Transverse Flute as a durable, maintenance-free instrument tuned to 440Hz for precision, resistant to cracks, sunlight, and drops, with added value features like tutorial videos, a velvet cover, and a protective case. While the seller’s image aligns with this description, the buyer’s review indicates dissatisfaction, stating that the product does not work as intended. The buyer’s inability to return the product due to their travel schedule compounds their frustration but is unrelated to the flute’s functionality. The defect in the product directly contradicts the seller’s claims of reliability and performance, suggesting a lapse in quality control. The fault lies with the seller for delivering a defective product, highlighting the need for improved quality assurance to ensure customer satisfaction.",
