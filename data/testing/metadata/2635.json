    "seller_description": "The Control D Nebulizer is designed to provide effective nebulization for the entire family, featuring both adult and child-sized masks for easier inhalation. With a medication capacity of 5 ml and a power requirement of 230 V AC, 50 Hz, and 75 W power consumption, it ensures efficient atomization of medication into fine particles, allowing for more effective delivery to the respiratory tract. It does not work with water; instead, it converts medication into a mist that is inhaled at room temperature through the mask. The nebulizer comes with a 12-month warranty from the date of invoice. It\u2019s important to note that nebulizers convert medicine into mist, while steamers convert water into hot steam, and these two products should not be confused, as they serve different respiratory care purposes.",
    "review": "I expected this nebulizer to also work as a steamer, but it doesn't, and this was very disappointing.",
    "Expected-output": "The buyer incorrectly assumed that the nebulizer would function as a steamer. The seller explicitly mentions that the nebulizer converts medicine into mist and differentiates it from steamers. The buyer\u2019s dissatisfaction stems from an incorrect assumption, and the product is delivered as described by the seller, with no fault lying on the seller.",
