    "review": "Very bad product because 2 times are change product but not properly work this product and return policy is closed very bad service",
    "expected-output": "In the seller’s image, the watch appears to have a white dial, while the buyer’s image shows a watch with a darker (possibly navy) dial, suggesting a potential discrepancy in color. However, the primary issue raised in the buyer’s review is that the watch fails to function properly, even after two exchanges, and the return policy no longer applies. The seller’s description emphasizes Japanese quartz movement, a 2–3-year battery lifespan, and overall durability. The buyer’s negative experience directly conflicts with these claims, indicating repeated product failures rather than a mere difference in appearance. As a result, the buyer remains dissatisfied and expresses frustration with the seller’s service. From a neutral standpoint, this points to the seller’s responsibility for not providing a reliably working product as advertised, regardless of any color mismatch.",
    "label": "0: Here seller is at fault."
