    "review": "I bought this to use as a fish tank. I put water in it to simulate a small aquarium setup. The size is great for that purpose, and the color matches my room decor. It's a bit too small for my actual cooking needs, but works well for my fish!",
    "expected-output": "Seller’s Description vs. Buyer’s Review: The seller describes the DEZIN electric cooking pot as a versatile, portable cooking appliance ideal for a variety of dishes. It highlights features such as a non-stick coating, adjustable temperature settings, and the ability to sauté, cook, and even boil food. The product is marketed as a practical and safe option for dorms and travel, with convenient features like easy cleaning, health-conscious cooking, and compact storage. The buyer, however, uses the product for a completely unrelated purpose—setting it up as a fish tank. They mention using the pot to simulate a small aquarium setup, which has no connection to the intended use for cooking food. The buyer appreciates the product's size and color for this application but does not provide any relevant feedback regarding its cooking performance or the advertised features for food preparation. Discrepancy: The review is irrelevant to the seller’s description, as it discusses using the pot as a fish tank rather than for cooking. The review does not mention key aspects of the product’s functionality related to cooking, such as the non-stick coating, temperature control, or safety features. Instead, the focus is entirely on its aesthetic and suitability for a non-cooking use case. Conclusion: The review does not provide any useful information for customers evaluating the product for its intended use in cooking. The buyer’s feedback about using the pot as a fish tank is unrelated to the product's designed purpose and does not address any of the advertised cooking features. Therefore, the review is unhelpful for potential buyers considering the product for cooking purposes. The fault lies with the buyer in this case. The review is irrelevant to the seller’s description and fails to provide feedback on the product’s actual performance for cooking. The review focuses on a non-cooking application, making it unhelpful for others evaluating the product for its intended use.\" }",
