    "expected-output": "The CP PLUS EzyKam smart camera is advertised as a high-quality home security device offering 1080P Full HD video, 360-degree rotational view, motion detection and tracking, privacy mode, night vision, and smart home integration with Alexa and Google Home. The product images and buyer photos show consistency in design and packaging, indicating that the physical product delivered matches the seller's description. However, the buyer's review reflects moderate dissatisfaction, rating the camera as average without specifying clear issues, which suggests that the product may have met the technical specifications but failed to meet subjective expectations. Since there is no evidence of misleading claims or significant defects, neither the seller nor the buyer is entirely at fault.",
