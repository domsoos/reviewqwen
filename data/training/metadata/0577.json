    "review": "3 of the 4 boxes were busted and rice was leaking out. Rice was even in bottom of shipping box. One box was busted then repaired with tape. Do not think I can use them, because of safety concerns.",
    "expected-output": "Seller's Description: The seller promotes the Minute White Rice as a simple, non-GMO, gluten-free product with a single ingredient: rice. The rice is advertised as quick to prepare, taking only 5 minutes, and is suitable for various meals. The description highlights its suitability for a balanced diet and the convenience it brings to family meals. Seller's Image: The seller's image showcases a pristine, intact box of Minute White Rice, emphasizing the product's simplicity and branding. The box is clean and undamaged, conveying quality and freshness. Buyer's Image: The buyer's image reveals boxes with visible damage and rice spillage. One box appears to have been previously repaired with tape, suggesting it was shipped in less-than-optimal condition. Loose rice can be seen within the packaging, which raises concerns about potential contamination. Buyer's Review: The buyer expresses dissatisfaction, noting that three out of the four boxes were damaged, leading to rice leakage. The presence of rice at the bottom of the shipping box implies poor packaging or handling. The buyer also mentions safety concerns regarding the use of the rice, as damaged packaging can compromise food safety. Conclusion: The buyer is dissatisfied due to the damaged condition of the product upon delivery. The issue appears to be related to either packaging or handling during shipment, rather than the product's advertised qualities (quick preparation, gluten-free, non-GMO, etc.). The damaged boxes, with one taped up, do not align with the seller’s promise of a fresh and intact product. This discrepancy lies with the seller or shipper, as the product did not arrive in the condition portrayed in the seller’s image.\" The fault lies with the seller or shipper in this case. The damaged packaging and rice spillage indicate issues with either the packaging quality or handling during shipping. The product did not arrive in the fresh, intact condition promised in the seller's description and image. Such issues could potentially compromise food safety, understandably leading to buyer dissatisfaction. Ensuring better packaging and careful handling during shipment would likely resolve these concerns in future deliveries.",
