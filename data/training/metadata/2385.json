    "review": "We use a variety of brands of supplements. Nature Made has been around for a long time, and is easily found in store and online. Good stuff.I acquired these for my husband who does not seek any sort of supplementation, but in the past i have been successful by buying a container of gummies and keeping them out where he can easily grab them. He uses them intermittently, so sometimes I am using them up. This set of gummies has a good assortment of vitamins and minerals, with extra B12 for energy. Nice amount of zinc too. Many supplements fall short on that mineral. Just take a closer look to see if it meets your needs when taking into account other supplements and food choices. This should certainly bridge the gap.Contains no synthetic dyes, no artificial flavors, no high fructose corn syrup, and no artificial sweeteners. This daily multivitamin for men helps support muscle health, immune health, and provides energy metabolism supportI tried them. Good flavor, good chew. Doesnt stick to teeth. Good option for those that simply prefer gummies. Dont like gummies? Look for their non gummy options",
