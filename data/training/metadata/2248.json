This eliminates the need to fumble for switches in the dark, preventing accidents. Additionally, these lights can be set to always-on mode for continuous use during the day or for tasks like reading, camping, or as a flashlight. Featuring 40 energy-efficient LEDs and a non-glare frosted cover, these dimmable lights offer 5 brightness levels, providing flexibility for both bright task lighting and softer night lighting without disturbing others. The lights are USB-C rechargeable with a built-in 1800mAh battery, offering up to 30 days of use in motion sensor mode or 8 hours in always-on mode at full brightness.
