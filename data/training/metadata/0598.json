    "seller_description": "Product details: Package Dimensions : 7.8 x 5.12 x 2.99 inches; 9 ounces. Manufacturer : The Only Bean. ASIN : B09FFXR2VV",
    "review": "No where in the product description, pictures, or even the packaging box does it say this is a Product of China, yet in small print on the individual packet there it is. Knowing where a food product is produced is important, especially when something is advertised as certified (non-GMO, vegan, etc).",
    "expected-output": "Seller\u2019s Description and Images: The product is described as a high-protein, keto-friendly, gluten-free, and vegan edamame bean snack, packaged with 11g protein and low net carbs (2g). The images show a vibrant, appealing blue package, emphasizing its high protein content and health-focused credentials (non-GMO, vegan, gluten-free). The description does not specify the country of origin. Buyer\u2019s Images and Review: The buyer's image shows the product packaging with \u201cProduct of China\u201d noted on the back in smaller print, which contrasts with the brand\u2019s health-focused and certified attributes. The buyer expresses concern about the product being sourced from China and mentions that this information was not clearly visible in the main product listing. Discrepancies and Analysis: Product of China Issue: The seller\u2019s description and primary images do not disclose the origin of the product. The buyer finds this problematic, especially since certifications like non-GMO and vegan can influence perceptions of quality and safety, and they would have preferred more transparency. Satisfaction Level: The buyer appears dissatisfied due to the lack of transparency about the product\u2019s origin, even though they do not mention any issues with the taste, texture, or quality of the product itself. Fault Analysis: The buyer\u2019s dissatisfaction stems from the seller\u2019s omission of the product\u2019s origin in the listing. This information is only found in small print on the package, which can be perceived as misleading. Conclusion: The seller should consider adding the country of origin to the product\u2019s description and images to improve transparency and address customer expectations. The buyer\u2019s dissatisfaction is valid, as full disclosure about the product\u2019s origin is essential for informed purchasing decisions, especially for health-conscious consumers. The fault lies primarily with the seller in this case. While the product aligns with the promised nutritional and health benefits, the omission of the country of origin in the main listing may be seen as a lack of transparency. For health-conscious consumers, especially those who prioritize product origin, clearly disclosing \"Product of China\" could be essential information. The buyer's dissatisfaction is valid, as they expected full transparency to make an informed decision. The seller could address this by adding origin details to the product description and images, ensuring clear disclosure upfront.",
