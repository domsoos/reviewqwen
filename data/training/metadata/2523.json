    "review": "The dash cam stopped functioning within a week of use. The rear camera image quality is far from what was promised, and the WiFi connection often fails to connect, making it difficult to download videos as advertised.",
    "Expected-output": "The seller described the ARIFAYZ Q4 4K Dash Cam Front and Rear as delivering exceptional image quality and seamless WiFi connectivity for live streaming and downloads. However, the buyer's review highlights significant performance issues, including device malfunction and poor rear camera image quality, which contradicts the seller's claims of 4K Ultra HD and seamless app functionality. The buyer's images of poor night vision and setup difficulties further confirm the discrepancies. The dissatisfaction stems from performance shortcomings, placing the fault on the seller for not meeting advertised standards.",
