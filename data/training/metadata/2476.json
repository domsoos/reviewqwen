    "review": "The controllers have connectivity issues and frequently disconnect, making gameplay frustrating.",
    "Expected-output": "The buyer images display the controllers in a seemingly intact condition, but the review highlights connectivity problems. The seller's description emphasized precise Touch Plus Controllers, yet these issues contradict the advertised reliability. This misalignment suggests the seller's responsibility for providing faulty hardware or overstating the product's capabilities.",
