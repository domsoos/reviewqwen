    "review": "Doctor extra soft no 7 size we need,",
    "expected-output": "The seller describes the slippers as specifically designed for diabetic and orthopedic care, featuring extra softness, cushioning, and medical benefits to support individuals with foot ailments such as diabetes, plantar fasciitis, or orthopedic issues. Made from biodegradable EVA material with anti-skid rubber soles, they promise safety on wet surfaces, durability, and comfort while preventing blisters and scars. However, the buyer's review reflects dissatisfaction, stating they require a Doctor extra soft no 7 size  and does not clearly indicate whether the delivered size matched their need. Additionally, if there is a color mismatch between the product received and the seller\u2019s description or images, it adds to the buyer's dissatisfaction, though this is not explicitly stated in the review. The issue appears to be related to order specifications or expectations rather than the product's quality, which aligns with the seller's description. The seller is not at fault as the review does not point to any failure in delivering the described product features.",
