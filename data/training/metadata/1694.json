    "review": "before i buy one product for keyboard clening, not worth but this one is ok good cleaning for car cup holders and side door cleaning under, arm rest",
    "expected-output": "The buyer's review expresses a mixed opinion, acknowledging that the Universal Car Cleaning Gel works well for cleaning car cup holders and under the armrest but less so for keyboards. While the buyer initially compares it to a different product they had used for keyboards, the gel meets the seller's claims for cleaning car interior components, such as cup holders and side doors, as described in the seller's product description. The gel’s reusable, biodegradable, and non-sticky properties align with the buyer's experience, with no significant issues raised regarding its performance. The fault does not lie with the seller, as the product functions as described; rather, the buyer's dissatisfaction seems to stem from misapplying the product for a purpose it was not intended for, and the seller's product is suitable for car cleaning. Therefore, the product itself is not at fault, and the issue is more about the buyer's expectations.",
