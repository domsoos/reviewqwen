    "review": "The remote control stopped working within two weeks, and finding a replacement has been a hassle. Not the quality I expected.",
    "Expected-output": "The seller does not explicitly highlight remote control durability, but as part of the core product functionality, the failure reflects poorly on overall quality. The buyer's negative experience with the remote suggests a manufacturing or quality issue, placing the fault on the seller.",
