    "review": "I don't know if this was a delivery problem or a packaging problem, but one of the packs was opened when I received them. The foil seasoning package was missing from the pack. Not sure if someone thought it would be funny to take it or what happened to it, because the seasoning was not in the box or in the shipping package. It appears that the rest are fine, but definitely throwing out the open package. The box is nice and durable cause it didn't rip or tear. I believe they will taste just fine. Good price, great bargain, cheaper than I can buy them in store.",
    "expected-output": "Seller Description and Image: The seller’s image displays a neatly packed case of Maruchan Pork Flavor Ramen, with no visible damage or missing components. The product description emphasizes the range of Maruchan flavors, packaging, and overall quality, giving the impression of a product that meets standard quality expectations and is securely packed. Buyer Image and Review: The buyer's image shows an opened package within the case, with one ramen pack visibly damaged. Additionally, the seasoning packet is missing from this open pack. The review highlights disappointment due to the open pack and missing seasoning. The buyer suspects this could either be a result of shipping issues or tampering, although they confirm the rest of the packs appear fine. Despite this flaw, they express satisfaction with the price and overall durability of the box. Discrepancies: Packaging Integrity: There is a discrepancy in packaging integrity as one of the ramen packs arrived opened and without its seasoning packet, which contrasts with the seller’s implied assurance of a fully intact and sealed product. Condition Upon Arrival: The buyer’s experience suggests a deviation from the seller's advertised quality, as receiving an open pack compromises the expected freshness and completeness of the product. Conclusion: Buyer Satisfaction: The buyer is partially dissatisfied, particularly with the individual opened package and missing seasoning. However, they do not report a completely negative experience due to the rest of the packs being intact and the reasonable price. Reason for Dissatisfaction: The issue seems to stem from either a delivery mishap or inadequate quality control, resulting in compromised packaging for at least one unit. While not entirely attributed to the seller's control, the defect impacts the buyer's confidence in the product’s quality.\" The seller is partially at fault due to a quality control or packaging issue, as one of the ramen packs arrived opened and missing its seasoning packet. Although the buyer is satisfied with the price and overall condition of the rest of the box, this flaw impacted their confidence in the product’s quality, leading to partial dissatisfaction.",
