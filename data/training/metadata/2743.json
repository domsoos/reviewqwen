    "review": "While the sound is clear and crisp, the earphones are slightly larger than expected, making them uncomfortable for prolonged use.",
    "Expected_output": "The seller emphasizes ergonomic design for comfort during prolonged use. The buyer's feedback on discomfort suggests a mismatch in expectations regarding size, but the core functionality and sound quality meet the described standards. This appears to be a subjective opinion rather than a fault in the product.",
