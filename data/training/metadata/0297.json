    "review": "Product is looking good and strong. But the width should be little bigger. Bigger books are coming out of the edges.",
    "expected-output": "Product Description by Seller: The seller describes the shelf unit as an engineered wood piece with an antique style, suitable for home offices, bedrooms, or living rooms. The shelf boasts seven tiers for ample storage and claims durability features such as waterproofing, rust-proofing, and weather resistance. The measurements provided—17 cm depth, 30 cm width, and 82 cm height—suggest it is a medium-sized unit. The seller emphasizes durability and visual appeal. Buyer Review and Images: The buyer mentions that the product appears sturdy and visually appealing but notes a functional limitation: the width is insufficient for larger books, which protrude from the shelf edges. The buyer expresses satisfaction with the product's appearance and strength but highlights this dimensional constraint as a drawback. Comparison and Observations: Visual Match: The product shown in the buyer's image aligns with the seller's images in design and appearance, showcasing the same angular, seven-tier structure. The finish and style also match the description of an antique, engineered wood piece. Functionality and Specifications: The seller’s dimensions are accurate, and the product appears to be as described in terms of style, tier count, and general durability. However, the buyer’s complaint about width suggests that the product’s functionality may not be optimal for storing larger books, despite the ample tier count. Satisfaction and Discrepancy: While the buyer appreciates the aesthetic and durability, there’s a clear discrepancy in functionality due to size limitations for larger books. This reflects a minor mismatch between buyer expectations and the product's design. Conclusion: The buyer is mostly satisfied but expresses a functional concern, particularly about width constraints. This feedback does not indicate a fault with the seller’s description, as the dimensions were provided; however, it may highlight an improvement area for the product. The feedback appears to be an opinion rather than dissatisfaction with quality or misleading marketing. Therefore, no party is at fault, but the seller could consider adding a note about suitability for smaller books to manage customer expectations more effectively.",
