    "seller_description": "This complete and balanced dog food is specially formulated for adult dogs, providing 20% crude protein, 10% crude fat, and 5% crude fiber. It promotes strong muscles, bones, and teeth, while also supporting a healthier, shinier coat. Additionally, it aids in digestive health and supports your dog's natural defenses. Dogs require higher levels of nutrients like calcium, iron, and vitamin B12 compared to humans, making this food an ideal choice for their needs. Developed by experts at the Waltham Centre for Pet Nutrition, it comes in a convenient bag container for easy storage and serving.",
    "review": "Flavor liked by my pets, rate is a bit high and fresh product as per date of package. Defective packaging both from inside and outside. Pedigree and Amazon packaging is defective. It seems to be careless on Amazon part. Overall product packaging date is 16/07/2021.",
    "expected-output": "The seller describes the dog food as a complete and balanced nutritional option for adult dogs, with essential nutrients like protein, fat, and fiber to promote strong muscles, bones, teeth, and a shiny coat. It also claims to support digestive health and natural defenses, making it suitable for meeting the specific nutritional needs of dogs. However, the buyer's review indicates mixed feedback. While the flavor of the food is appreciated by the pets, and the product appears fresh as per the packaging date, the buyer highlights defective packaging, both internally and externally. The review attributes this issue to negligence, primarily on Amazon's part, rather than the seller's. The buyer does not express dissatisfaction with the product's quality but raises valid concerns about its packaging, which could affect its usability and customer experience.The discrepancy lies in the defective packaging, which does not align with the seller's claim of convenience and reliability. The fault appears to lie with Amazon or the logistics chain rather than the seller or the product itself, as the food quality meets expectations, but the handling and packaging process fell short.",
