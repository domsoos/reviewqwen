    "seller_description": "This semi-automatic top-loading washer comes ready to use with no installation or demo required, and all features are detailed in the included user manual. Equipped with a powerful 270 W motor and hydrologic pulsator, it generates a strong water flow for efficient cleaning. With a 6.5 kg capacity, it is ideal for families of 3 to 4 members. The washer offers two wash programs and comes with a 1-year comprehensive warranty and an additional 6-year warranty on the motor, ensuring durability and reliability.",
    "review": "The plastic body feels cheap and fragile. I am concerned it won\u2019t last long.",
    "Expected-output": "The buyer's review critiques the material quality, while the seller highlights the durability with a 1-year comprehensive warranty and a 6-year warranty on the motor. The buyer's image of the washer does not show any visible defects or inconsistencies with the seller's images. The buyer's concern appears to be subjective and based on perception rather than any evident flaw in the product. The seller cannot be faulted here as the product matches the description.",
