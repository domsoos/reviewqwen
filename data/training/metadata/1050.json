    "expected-output":"In examining the seller’s description of the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2—a product touted for its robust battery life, fast charging, durable construction (including IP55 water- and sweat-resistance), and advanced audio features—there is a clear discrepancy with the buyer’s experience. The buyer specifically reports receiving a defective unit with broken wires, indicating a failure of the physical product rather than a mere misunderstanding of its advertised capabilities. This suggests that the issue lies in the product’s condition upon delivery, which contrasts sharply with the seller’s emphasis on durability and reliability. From a neutral standpoint, the buyer’s dissatisfaction stems directly from a fault in the item itself, rather than an incorrect expectation or personal preference, implying that the seller is at fault for delivering a damaged or non-functional product.",
