    "expected-output": "The seller describes the product as an ultra-warm dog jacket with a fleece-lined interior designed for cold weather. It features a stylish army camouflage pattern, durable and weather-resistant materials to keep dogs dry and warm, and an easy-on, top-only design with adjustable straps for a secure fit, ensuring comfort for large breeds without covering the legs or chest. The buyer praises the jacket for its perfect fit on their Labrador, good material quality, and reasonable price, meeting their expectations. However, the buyer reports receiving a blue jacket instead of the green one they ordered, highlighting a color mix-up. Despite this issue, the buyer expresses overall satisfaction with the product's fit, quality, and value for money. The seller should ensure accurate order fulfillment, particularly in color specifications, and offer easy returns or exchanges to maintain customer satisfaction.",
