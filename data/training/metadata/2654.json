    "review": "The charging port is very flimsy and broke after a single use. This product feels cheaply made and unreliable.",
    "Expected-output": "The buyer highlights a poorly constructed charging port, contrary to the seller's description emphasizing high-quality design. The seller's images showcase a robust charging system, while the buyer's images suggest otherwise. The product does not meet expectations, marking the seller's responsibility for the defect.",
