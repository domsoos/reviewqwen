    "review": "There were maggots creeping out as soon as i opened the outer packet..when I called the customer care they asked me send a picture. The pack could not be touched after seeing the creepy crawlers leave alone taking a picture. It is unacceptable that there is no quality check by the seller before shipping the product.",
    "expected-output": " The seller advertises Whiskas Junior Kitten Wet Cat Food as a nutritious, balanced option for kittens aged 2-12 months, featuring chicken in gravy to appeal to kittens' tastes. It claims to provide complete nutrition with Omega 6, Zinc, DHA, and Taurine for healthy skin, coat, brain, and eyesight development, and 41 essential nutrients for growth and muscle support. However, the buyer reported finding maggots in the product, citing a serious hygiene issue that rendered it unusable. The lack of quality checks and insufficient customer support further exacerbated the issue, leading to frustration. To address such incidents, the seller should strengthen quality control measures, investigate supply chain processes, offer immediate apologies and resolutions, and ensure rigorous checks to restore customer trust.",
