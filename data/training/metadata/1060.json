    "review": "First, no adapter provided. Secondly, no 5GHz wifi support. Thirdly, keeps disconnecting from normal wifi network. Quite annoying it's sound when it keeps on saying no wifi connection, wifi connection successfully. It keeping on doing this even when wifi router is in the same room. Overall, poor product not recommended for any use.",
    "expected-output": "The CP PLUS EzyKam, as described by the seller, offers advanced features like 1080P Full HD clarity, 360-degree rotational coverage, motion detection, motion tracking, and compatibility with Alexa and Google Home, aiming to provide a seamless surveillance experience. The seller emphasizes its versatility, nighttime visibility through IR lights, and privacy mode, which appear well-suited for smart home integration. However, the buyer\u2019s review paints a contrasting picture, citing several functional shortcomings such as the absence of an adapter, lack of 5GHz WiFi support, and frequent disconnections even when in close proximity to the router. The recurring notifications about WiFi connectivity issues are highlighted as particularly frustrating. These issues undermine the usability of the product and the expectations set by the seller's claims. Visual comparison between the product images provided by the seller and the buyer confirms that the camera design matches; however, the functional deficiencies overshadow the physical alignment. The dissatisfaction expressed by the buyer is clearly tied to operational shortcomings and the product's inability to meet basic connectivity requirements, pointing to a fault in the product rather than subjective bias. The seller's descriptions of the camera's advanced capabilities seem overly optimistic and do not align with the practical experience shared by the buyer.",
