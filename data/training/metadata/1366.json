    "seller_description": "These gym wrist wraps are the perfect accessory for training, whether you're a beginner or a seasoned weightlifter. Designed for strength training, powerlifting, bodybuilding, and push movements like bench press or shoulder press, they provide adjustable compression for a secure fit without restricting circulation or causing discomfort. Made from high-quality cotton and elastic, they contour around your wrists to stabilize joints, reduce tension, and improve form, enabling you to train harder and lift more confidently. Lightweight, breathable polyester with reinforced stitching ensures durability, while sweat-resistant, odor-free fibers keep skin dry and comfortable. Equipped with strong thumb loops, these wraps stay securely in place, allowing you to focus entirely on your workout. Suitable for men, women, and kids, they help redirect pressure from wrists to targeted muscles, enhancing performance in activities like basketball, cycling, weightlifting, and even tasks such as typing, driving, or carrying. With their versatile design, these wraps are a must-have for achieving your fitness and daily activity goals faster.",

    "expected-output": "The seller describes the gym wrist wraps as high-quality accessories designed for a range of activities, emphasizing durability, comfort, and flexibility with features like sweat-resistant fibers, reinforced stitching, and high-quality elastic for a secure fit. However, the buyer’s review highlights dissatisfaction, stating the product was very old and the elastic became loose upon first use, directly contradicting the seller’s claims of durability and quality. This discrepancy indicates a failure in quality control or a manufacturing defect, as the product did not meet the advertised standards or perform its intended function. The fault lies with the seller, and the buyer’s dissatisfaction is valid, emphasizing the need for improved quality assurance to ensure products meet expectations.",
