    "review": "This product is great. The mic has very good quality and it works very well. One thing I would have to say though, is that you have to be very careful about the Bluetooth thing that you plug into your phone. It is very vulnerable to damage as if you drop your phone the wrong way it will bend off the piece that goes into your phone and it will stop working. I was using the microphone and it was plugged into my phone and I didn\u2019t even drop my phone at all when these were in use. It bends very easily, and the connection is broken almost immediately as well. The smallest amount of pressure will ruin the entire product.",
    "expected-output": "The buyer is generally satisfied with the VOOK wireless microphone\u2019s sound quality and performance, but expresses dissatisfaction with the fragility of the Bluetooth connector, which is prone to damage with minimal pressure, even without dropping the phone. The seller's description emphasizes the microphone's good sound quality, ease of use, and compatibility with various devices, but it fails to mention the vulnerability of the connector, leading to a gap between the buyer\u2019s expectations and actual experience. While the microphone performs well in terms of audio quality, the issue with the connector\u2019s durability points to a design flaw not addressed in the product description. Therefore, the fault lies with the seller for not warning about or addressing this potential weakness, leaving the buyer disappointed with a critical aspect of the product's build quality.",
