    "review": "I bought this for a camping trip and used it to cook some food outdoors. It heats up quickly and is really lightweight, making it perfect for my setup. However, the coil started making strange noises after just one use, which was really annoying. I was able to still use it, but I'm concerned it won't last long. I also wish it came with a better storage solution for the cord.",
    "expected-output": "The review reflects satisfaction with the product's portability and heating capability, which meets the buyer's needs for a camping trip. However, the buyer experienced an issue with the coil making strange noises after a single use, suggesting potential durability concerns. While the product performed well during the initial use, the concern about the coil\u2019s longevity raises questions about its overall durability. The buyer also expresses a desire for a better storage solution for the cord, indicating that while the burner meets some needs, there are some design improvements that could enhance the overall user experience. In this case, the fault lies with the product's durability, specifically the coil making strange noises after minimal use, which is an unexpected issue for the buyer. This indicates that the product might have some manufacturing inconsistencies or a defect, though the buyer\u2019s experience suggests that the product is usable for short-term use. The seller\u2019s description of the product does not address these concerns regarding the coil\u2019s longevity or the cord storage, which could be an oversight in product design or quality control.\" }",
