    "seller_description": "The VOOK wireless microphone features advanced 3-level noise reduction technology powered by a DSP intelligent chip, allowing you to enjoy professional-grade audio in both quiet and noisy environments. It offers universal compatibility with iOS and Android devices, including a Type-C to Lightning adapter for iPhones, iPads, and Android devices with OTG support (Micro USB ports are not included). The omnidirectional microphone ensures 360° sound capture with high sensitivity, and it pairs automatically with your device—no Bluetooth required. With a transmission range of up to 65ft/20m and real-time auto-sync technology, it delivers seamless audio recording, while its built-in rechargeable battery offers up to 8 hours of use after a 1-2 hour charge. The microphone comes with a 1-year warranty and consultation service, and if you encounter any issues, customer support is available. For Android users, ensure the OTG function is enabled, and if your default camera app doesn’t support the mic, download a third-party app like Open Camera to select the external microphone as the audio source.",
    "review": "One mic stopped working and I lost my wonderful teaching session of 45 minutes where only video was recorded and no audio. Even the surrounding audio was not recorded. It's a shame I could have just recorded with mobile without this gadget. I coul have got my teaching with audio. I'm going to record again tomorrow.",
    "expected-output": "The seller markets the VOOK wireless microphone as a professional-grade product with advanced features like noise reduction, universal compatibility, seamless pairing, and a reliable 8-hour battery life. However, the buyer reports a critical failure where one microphone stopped working during a 45-minute teaching session, leading to the complete loss of audio in the recording. This failure significantly undermines the product's reliability and contradicts the seller's promise of delivering seamless audio recording. The buyer's dissatisfaction is justified, as the issue directly impacted the usability of the microphone for its intended purpose. The fault lies with the seller, as the microphone did not perform as expected, causing a significant inconvenience.",
