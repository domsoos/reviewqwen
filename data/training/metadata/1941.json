    "review": "Size matched as expected. But not that much expected quality material used.",
    "expected-output": "The buyer\u2019s review suggests a discrepancy between their expectations and the actual product quality. While the buyer confirms that the size matched their expectations, they express dissatisfaction with the material quality, indicating that it did not meet their expectations. The seller's description highlights durable polyester material, water-repellent coating, and other features aimed at superior protection and functionality, which were not fully appreciated by the buyer. This indicates that while the product fits as described, the quality of the material might not have been as robust as the buyer anticipated. The dissatisfaction seems to be more about the material rather than the functionality or fit. Therefore, it appears that the issue lies with the buyer\u2019s expectations not aligning with the actual quality of the material, which was described but perhaps not as evidently durable in practice.",
