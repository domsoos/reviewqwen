    "seller_description": "This set of heavy-duty plastic vacuum compression storage bags is perfect for saving space and protecting your belongings. Designed to compress bulky textiles, clothing, linens, and more by up to 80%, these bags are an ideal solution for maximizing storage. They safeguard items from moisture, dirt, insects, mold, odors, and other potential damage. Each bag features a heavy-duty valve and a double-seal zipper to ensure airtight protection. The pack includes five large bags (80 x 60 cm) and comes with a convenient hand pump, or you can connect the bags to any standard vacuum cleaner hose for quicker results.",
    "review": "The plastic material feels very flimsy and tears easily. I had to replace two bags right after the first use.",
    "Expected-output": "The seller description emphasizes heavy-duty material, but the buyer's image showing tears contradicts this claim. The material's flimsiness as described by the buyer is inconsistent with the advertised durability. The dissatisfaction here directly points to a flaw in the product, making the seller at fault.",
