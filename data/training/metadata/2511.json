    "review": "The watch screen is very dim and barely visible outdoors. The touch screen lags frequently, making navigation frustrating.",
    "Expected-output": "The seller\u2019s description highlights an HD-color full touch screen and ease of navigation. However, the buyer\u2019s images show a dimly lit screen, contradicting the seller's claim. The touch lag further diverges from the promised seamless usability. This mismatch indicates dissatisfaction due to performance issues, placing the fault on the seller for overpromising.",
