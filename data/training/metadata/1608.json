    "seller_description": "This capo is crafted from high-quality, lightweight zinc alloy, ensuring durability and a strong, padded spring-action grip for precise tension. It is designed to fit perfectly on electric and acoustic guitars, ukuleles, banjos, bass guitars, folk guitars, and mandolins. The capo is incredibly easy to use, allowing quick fret changes with one hand without disturbing the tuning. The high-quality silicone pad protects your instrument from scratches and fret buzz while maintaining proper pressure for optimal performance. With its steel spring and internal memory, it provides strength, resistance to fatigue, and stays in tune with excellent intonation across all frets.",
    "review": "The clamp mechanism will lose grip and come out from the capo and if it gets lost, the capo will completely lose its functionality.",
    "expected-output": "The capo is described as a high-quality accessory designed for various string instruments, offering features like a strong spring-action grip, silicone padding for protection, and durability due to its zinc alloy construction. However, the buyer's review highlights a critical issue with the clamp mechanism, which reportedly loses grip and can detach, rendering the capo non-functional if the part is lost. This indicates a significant flaw in the product's design or quality control, directly impacting its core functionality. While the seller promises durability and optimal performance, the buyerâ€™s negative experience suggests that the product fails to consistently deliver these features, pointing to the seller's fault for not ensuring the reliability of the clamp mechanism.",
