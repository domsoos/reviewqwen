    "expected-output": "The seller’s description of the Bosch GWS 600 Professional Angle Grinder is detailed, listing features such as the 670W motor, ergonomic design, and additional accessories like the protective guard and lock-on switch. However, the buyer's review points out an issue with the body of the tool, describing it as damaged, and mentions that they are unable to return it. This discrepancy suggests a quality control issue with the product and an unsatisfactory post-purchase experience with the seller's return policy. The buyer is dissatisfied due to the damage to the product and the difficulty in returning it, indicating that the fault lies with the seller’s product condition and potentially their customer service or return process.",
