    "review": "It's too hard and more weight to use",
    "expected-output": "The seller describes the NIVIA Men Flash 2.0 Non-Marking Badminton Shoes as lightweight, durable, and comfortable, featuring a soft NR EVA sock liner and PVC synthetic leather upper for breathability, with forepart stitching for toe support. However, the buyer's review indicates dissatisfaction, stating the shoes are too hard and more weight to use,suggesting they found them uncomfortable and heavier than expected, which detracts from their usability for badminton. The seller's image portrays the shoes as sleek and performance-oriented, while the buyer's image shows the actual product received, with no visible defects. The discrepancies lie in the perceived weight and comfort; the buyer's experience of the shoes being heavy and hard contrasts with the seller's claims of lightweight comfort. In conclusion, the buyer's dissatisfaction stems from a mismatch between their expectations and the actual product features, particularly regarding weight and cushioning, indicating that the seller's description may not fully represent the product's characteristics.",
