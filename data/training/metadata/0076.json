    "review": "I don't like this product at all. It didn't work properly from the beginning. The motor is weak, and the brush doesn't move smoothly. It also made a weird sound every time I used it, which was annoying. I expected a lot more from this product.",
    "expected-output": "In this case, the buyer expresses dissatisfaction with the performance of the toothbrush, noting issues with the motor's power and its inability to work smoothly. They also mention an annoying sound during use, which contrasts with the seller’s promise of effective and quiet sonic cleaning. While the seller’s description emphasizes powerful cleaning and a smooth brushing experience, the buyer’s feedback suggests that the product fails to meet these expectations. The product's functionality and motor quality do not align with the advertised features, leading to frustration for the buyer. The fault here lies with the seller, as the product does not perform as advertised, failing to deliver on key promises like motor power and smooth operation. The issues mentioned in the review indicate that the product either suffers from quality control problems or does not live up to the performance expectations set by the seller's description. Therefore, the dissatisfaction stems from the product’s failure to meet the expectations laid out in the description, and the issue appears to be with the product itself, rather than user misuse or expectations.",
