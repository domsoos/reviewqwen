    "review": "This is the exact fishing net I was hoping to receive. I am extremely happy with the size of this net and the telescoping length of over 50 inches long!!!The measurements of the net are 14 inches wide, 19 inches long and approximately 18 inches diagonal. You will be able to land a very good size fish with this net. It looks to be very sturdy and lightweight as well. I have compared this to other nets at West Marine at two times the price if not more. This is a good net for the price point as well.",
