    "review": "I got the 19\u201d one and although it\u2019s on the bigger side I\u2019ve really enjoyed it since it\u2019s folding and I can loop it on my gear and quickly access it. Great for strapping to the paddle board and taking up minimal space when not in use. Wide mouth net and telescopic pole make it nice for scooping one up while paddling. Helped me land my first brook trout or two on the fly and was nice having extra net to set it down in the water to remove the hook while not harming the fish. Quality product, will likely get the smaller one as well for when I\u2019m navigating close quarters for creek access.",
