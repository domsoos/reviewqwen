    "review": "I was struggling to heat water for tea and thought to purchase the easiest thing to use. I saw a friend use this at her house and I knew I had to get it. I fill this up and it boils the water within 30 seconds - a minute depending on how much water you put. I filled it to the max line before and the water was ready within a minute or 2, very impressive. My favorite thing about it is that it turns off on its own, which is great when I'm running around hosting or cooking a meal and can easily forget about it. I think that feature in itself gives this item 5 stars. Love it!",
