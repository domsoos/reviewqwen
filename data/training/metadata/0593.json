    "review": "I recently decided to pick up a case of Propel after going many years without it and I am so glad that I did! I was pleasantly surprised to find that the grape flavor was perfect. Most other zero calorie flavored sports waters have an over powering flavor that leaves a bad taste in my mouth. This was not the case with this product. This beverage is light and refreshing with the added bonus of electrolytes and vitamins. Perfect for after a work out session or even just to cool yourself down on a hot day.",
