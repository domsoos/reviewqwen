The buyer\u2019s review supports the seller's claims, mentioning the product\u2019s long-lasting effect, pleasant smell, and ability to make hair soft and manageable with minimal use. However, the buyer also notes a potential issue with leakage during travel, which may reflect a minor design flaw in the packaging.
