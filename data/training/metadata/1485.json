    "review": "Perfect fit and also quality is good, only one issue is this inside heel area used some cheap material",
    "expected-output": "The seller advertises these shoes as lightweight, breathable, and durable, featuring a flexible design, non-slip and shockproof construction, air-cushioned outsoles for enhanced shock absorption, and slip resistance. They are marketed as relieving foot pain and pressure for long-term comfort. The buyer is generally satisfied, praising the perfect fit and overall good quality but notes a flaw with the inside heel area, which uses a cheaper material that could impact comfort or durability. While the images confirm the buyer received the correct product, the issue with the heel contrasts with the seller\u2019s claim of high-quality construction, indicating a minor discrepancy. Despite this, the shoes meet most expectations, with the fault lying in the specific material choice for the heel, affecting the overall experience slightly.",
