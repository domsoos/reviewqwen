    "review": "The watch looks good when bought but in TWO months the outer dial case of steel colour is fading. Not worth the money spent on the watch.",
    "expected-output": "The seller describes the OLEVS analog quartz watch as a premium accessory featuring a solid stainless steel bracelet, a durable outer case, and a classic design with diamond Roman indexes. The watch is presented as stylish, durable, and capable of meeting the everyday needs of its wearer, including 3ATM water resistance and luminous functionality. However, the buyer’s review points out that while the watch initially looks good, the outer steel-colored dial case begins fading within two months of purchase. This significant issue suggests a discrepancy between the seller’s description, which emphasizes durability and high quality, and the product’s actual performance. The fading of the outer case compromises the watch’s long-term value and aesthetic appeal, leading to dissatisfaction from the buyer. This failure to meet expectations regarding durability indicates that the seller is at fault for not delivering a product that aligns with its advertised claims of premium quality.",
