    "expected-output": "The seller presents the Casio watch as a compact and reliable everyday accessory, highlighting its dimensions, craftsmanship by Casio India Co Pvt Ltd, and aesthetic appeal. The seller's images display a vintage digital watch with a stainless steel strap and a sleek, retro design. This aligns well with the product description, promising a stylish and functional timepiece.The buyer's images confirm the product's visual match with the seller's description and images, showcasing the watch's stainless steel strap and its vintage appearance on the wrist. However, the buyer's review expresses mixed feelings, noting that while the watch is appealing, its size is smaller than anticipated, leading to a less-than-satisfactory experience. The buyer characterizes the product as overrated and mentions it does not align with their personal preference, although there is no indication of a defect or misleading claims from the seller.In this scenario, the buyer's dissatisfaction stems from unmet personal expectations regarding the watch's size, which was not explicitly highlighted in the product description. The fault does not lie with the seller, as the product's specifications and appearance were accurately depicted. Instead, this is a case of the buyer expressing subjective disappointment rather than an objective flaw in the product or its presentation. For better customer satisfaction, the seller could consider including clearer size references or wrist-fit images in the product description to help potential buyers gauge the watch's proportions more effectively.",
