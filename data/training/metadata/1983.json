    "review": "Color is not good I want to return this product can u pls refund my money this is my request to Amazon partners",
    "expected-output": "The buyer's review indicates dissatisfaction with the color of the wallet, stating that it does not meet their expectations. The seller's description emphasizes the wallet\u2019s organizational features and comfort, but there is no mention of color variations or how the product might differ from what the buyer expected. The buyer is requesting a return and refund due to this issue. This suggests that the discrepancy is related to the product's appearance (color), which was not as anticipated. The issue lies with the seller\u2019s lack of clarity regarding color representation, as the product's color is a crucial factor for the buyer's satisfaction. Therefore, the fault appears to be with the seller for not managing color expectations properly.",
