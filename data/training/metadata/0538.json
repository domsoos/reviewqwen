    "review": "These shoes are lightweight and easy to walk in. Heel height measures approximately 2.75 inches. Platform height measures approximately 1.5 inches. All of the straps are soft and will allow for some stretch, but I didn't need it. I tried the white in a size 7. I have a medium width foot.
