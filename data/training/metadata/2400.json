    "review": "This high polish brass heavy armor lighter, by Zippo, was a great bargain on amazon. The recommended retail price was US$29.95, whereas this price (US$19.91) was an absolute bargain! Even though I'm in New Zealand, the seller, HatShark, was very prompt and sent it down to me within 8 days, so imagine how fast it would ship within the USA. The armor case is a lot heavier than the regular Zippos, and I like the feel of it in my hand, with the extra weight and all. The case is also 1.5 times thicker than a standard Zippo making it extra durable. But the hinge remains the same as those on the regular Zippos, meaning that the hinge on this lighter must take some extra weight and is more prone to break. It makes a more sturdy and lower pitched click when opened, but still with a rich and full tone. At first I was skeptical about whether this was a fake (rippo) or not as I couldn't see the bottom of it in the pictures, where the information to tell whether it's a genuine Zippo is, but it turned out to be as genuine as can be! I thought it was a bit careless of the seller to mention in the Product Description, that The Zippo High Polish Brass Armor Heavy lighter is just a plain gold zippo. It includes a black case with the logo Zippo on the low front center with gray dots right above it. This made me think twice about buying it. Of course the title said all there was to say about the lighter, but it would have been wise to include more detail in the Product Description. Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase. The box it came in was an added bonus which is very handy to keep it in.",
    "Expected_output": "The Zippo Classic Windproof Lighter in Street Brass fulfills its promises as a high-quality and stylish product, as demonstrated by the buyer's positive review and images. The seller\u2019s description highlights the lighter's windproof design, durable all-metal construction, and iconic click, emphasizing its reliability and aesthetic appeal. This aligns well with the buyer\u2019s praise for the lighter\u2019s robust feel, heavier armor case, and superior durability compared to standard Zippos. Both the seller and buyer images confirm the lighter\u2019s visual appearance as accurately described. The buyer also appreciated the reasonable pricing, fast international shipping, and the extra durability of the armor case, aligning with the seller's claim of premium quality. However, the buyer notes a minor concern about the hinge's ability to handle the added weight, suggesting room for improvement. This observation is not a fault of the seller but rather a design feature inherent to the product. Overall, the buyer is satisfied with their purchase, and there is no fault attributed to either the buyer or the seller in this transaction.",
