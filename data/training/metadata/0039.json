    "seller_description": "These shoes feature a leather upper for durability and a sleek look, while the ABZORB midsole cushioning helps absorb forceful impacts, providing enhanced comfort and support. The premium PU comfort insert adds an extra layer of cushioning, ensuring a soft, comfortable feel with every step.",
    "review": "I ordered these shoes for a trip to Peru, that I expected to have much walking. I have had difficulty with cobblestones causing blisters, as the footfall shifts around so much as opposed to flat surfaces as in the USA. These shoes fit well, and my feet were fine, the whole time. No foot pain limiting my enjoyment at Machu Picchu!!",
