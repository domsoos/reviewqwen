    "expected-output": "The seller describes Pedigree Dry Dog Food as a high-quality product providing complete and balanced nutrition with 37 essential nutrients to support dogs’ health. However, the buyer reports a severe issue, finding worms in the product and noting small holes in the packaging, indicating potential contamination. This suggests significant lapses in storage, packaging, or handling during transit. Additionally, confusion around batch and delivery dates highlights possible logistical errors. The product’s hygiene and safety concerns overshadow its nutritional promises, leading to serious dissatisfaction and posing a health risk to pets.",
