    "review": "Product is just ok. Average strong trolley not hard trolley",
    "expected-output": "The buyer's review expresses a sense of disappointment, stating that the trolley is just average in terms of strength, contrary to the seller\u2019s description of the product as a hard trolley made from durable materials. The seller highlights the trolley\u2019s scratch-resistant and impact-resistant features, suggesting superior durability, but the buyer feels the product doesn't fully meet these expectations, describing it as merely average. This discrepancy in expectations suggests that the product may not align perfectly with the buyer's desired level of sturdiness. Therefore, the buyer appears dissatisfied due to a mismatch between the seller's claims and the perceived quality of the product. The fault seems to lie with the product's strength not matching the buyer\u2019s expectations, although the seller's description does accurately reflect the general features, leading to some subjective differences in perception.",
