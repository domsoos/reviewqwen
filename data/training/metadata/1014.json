    "review": "This product is not good. at all This product is very small It is not what was shown in the photo yah.",
    "expected_output": "From a neutral standpoint, the seller\u2019s images and description present a pack of gray microfiber cloths measuring 16 x 16 inches, emphasizing durability and lint-free performance. The buyer\u2019s photograph appears consistent in color and stitching style, yet they complain that the product is much smaller than depicted and generally \u201cnot good.\u201d While it is unclear if the actual dimensions are indeed different from those advertised, the buyer\u2019s dissatisfaction centers on size and quality rather than a clear misrepresentation of features. Therefore, the product seems to align with the seller\u2019s general claims, indicating the buyer\u2019s dissatisfaction may stem more from personal expectations than from seller fault.",
