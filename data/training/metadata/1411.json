Seller\u2019s Image: The seller\u2019s image shows a well-lit picture of the sneakers but does not emphasize the end of the shoe, which may be contributing to the buyer\u2019s confusion regarding the fit. Discrepancies Identified Discrepancy in Product Appearance: The buyer expected a narrow-ended shoe based on the pictures, but the product received did not match this description. This is a clear discrepancy between the buyer's expectation and the actual product received. Conclusion The buyer is mostly satisfied with the quality, size, look, and shine of the sneakers. However, they are dissatisfied with the fit, specifically the narrowness of the shoe, which did not match the expectation set by the product images. The fault lies with the product's design presentation, which may have caused the misinterpretation.",
