    "review": "The packaging was inadequate, and one of the dumbbells was broken upon arrival. This is very disappointing as I was looking forward to using them.",
    "Expected-output": "The seller's description and images emphasize durability and high-quality PVC material, ensuring the product is long-lasting. However, the buyer's images reveal broken dumbbells and poor packaging, which directly contradicts the seller's claims. This suggests a failure in quality control and inadequate packaging. Here, the seller is at fault for not ensuring secure packaging and product quality.",
