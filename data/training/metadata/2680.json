    "review": "Battery life is nowhere near one month. It barely lasts a week even with minimal use.",
    "Expected-output": "The buyer's dissatisfaction stems from the battery life not matching the seller's claim of lasting up to one month on a full charge. This significant deviation from the promised feature undermines the product's reliability as marketed. The seller is at fault for overstating the battery's performance, leading to unmet expectations.",
