    "review": "Ok. I dont have a motorcycle but take this with more than just a grain of salt; first off I need to acknowledge the comfort of this helmet. Literally no discomfort at all. Fits me perfect. I used a tape measure and wrapped it around my head in order to get my size and I will say the size is more than what I expected. I\u2019m 5\u20197 120 lbs male and I expected a medium at most but I\u2019m actually a large. So get a size up than what you expect. Besides the size, the comfort is great. Now for the installation of the visor, I personally say that the black visor is the best and obviously the clear one for night time. I saw a review from someone saying how frustrated they were with swapping the visors and it actually is so easy. It takes less than 30 seconds. To swap the visors, flip it all the way up to reveal the red latch and pull on it. The latch will release a hook that allows you to adjust the visor to different positions. Now do the same on the other side and pull off the visor. There is a second hook on point that clicks in and out. Now to install the other visor position it in the same upwards position and just press the latches but in. Simple as. Now for the most important part, the durability. I just crashed my SurRon going 20 mph making a turn that was too sharp. My bike lost control and fell over to the left and if not for this helmet my head would\u2019ve hit the concrete and skid on the ground. Had some really bad wounds but that\u2019s besides the review. In the photos you could see the scratches and I literally did not have any head pain or anything. Refer to photos to see the damage on the helmet. Definitely would recommend.. ",
