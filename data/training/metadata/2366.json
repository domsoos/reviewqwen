    "review": "Very satisfied with this portable monitor. Set up was easy and instructions were clear. It came with attachments for Macbook (USB-C) and laptop (HDMI) and an external output. It will work without the external output as well as long as it can draw power from the connection (e.g., plugging it in your laptop). I've been using it with my MacBook air and it's been working smoothly. I like that ease of connection. The only thing I would note is that the magnetic cover can be a little tricky to figure out at first but once you have it working, it'll get easier.",
