    "review": "I decided to switch it up this school year and get these shoes after getting Air Force 1s since 8th grade (i'm going to be a senior this year) and OH MY GOODNESS this is actually the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn! I did expect them to be a little more white than a cream color but really it's not a big deal I still love them! 10/10 recommend these sneakers.",
