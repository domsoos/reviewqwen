    "review": "The material used for the mosquito net is so thin that it tore within days of use. This is not the high-quality product promised.",
    "Expected-output": "The seller emphasizes the use of '30 GSM strong quality mesh' in their description. However, the buyer's images highlight severe tears and thin material, which contradicts the durability claims made by the seller. The lack of alignment between the seller's description and the product received clearly indicates the seller's product did not meet the described standards.",
