    "expected-output": "The seller describes the 38-inch Acoustic Guitar as a high-quality instrument with a black glossy finish, an 18-fret design, and a smooth-playing combination of Linden and ebony wood. The guitar is advertised as durable, with full wood construction, Linden binding, and steel strings designed for a bright and resonant tone. The seller promises a complete package that includes a strap, bag, string set, and picks, catering to both beginners and experienced players. The seller’s image portrays the guitar as sleek, well-finished, and consistent with these claims.The buyer’s review reflects dissatisfaction, specifically pointing out that while the product’s finishing and strings are good, the handle's finish was broken upon arrival. Despite requesting a replacement, the second guitar also had the same issue, suggesting a recurring defect in quality control. This experience contradicts the seller’s promise of a durable and well-constructed guitar, particularly as the defect persisted across multiple units. The buyer’s frustration stems from both the product’s inability to meet advertised quality standards and the failure to resolve the issue through the replacement.Conclusion:The buyer is dissatisfied due to the recurring issue with the handle's finish, which undermines the seller’s claims of durability and quality. The fault lies with the seller, as the product's persistent defect highlights a lack of effective quality control during manufacturing. This situation indicates a need for the seller to improve their quality assurance processes to ensure that all guitars meet the advertised standards before shipment. Additionally, addressing customer concerns through effective resolutions, such as a thorough replacement process or better inspection, would help restore customer trust and satisfaction.",
