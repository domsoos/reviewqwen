    "review": "I have fairly small wrists (5.5 inches) and this is the first watch that I have ever been able to properly wear. It feels very luxurious despite only being $20. The only thing i have to complain about is that there should probably be a small tool included with the watch to open the clasp but besides that it is perfect.",
