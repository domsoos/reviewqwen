It is a healthy and hygienic alternative to regular table salt, making your meals both delicious and nourishing. Store it in a cool, dry place to maintain its quality and goodness",
    "review": "The packaging says 'store in a cool and dry place,' but the salt arrived already damp, which makes it hard to use.",
    "Expected-output": "The buyer highlights damp salt upon arrival, directly contradicting the seller\u2019s claim of quality and suitability for storage. The buyer\u2019s image aligns with their dissatisfaction, while the seller\u2019s description does not mention the possibility of dampness occurring during shipping. Fault lies with the seller for either poor packaging or failing to protect the product during transit.",
