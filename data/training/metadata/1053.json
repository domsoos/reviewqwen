    "review": "THIS MOUSE STOPPED WORKING AFTER 1 YEAR 10 MONTHS 9 DAYS FROM THE DAY I USE IT . thank you so much",
    "expected-output": "The seller description highlights the mouse's 1000 DPI resolution, ergonomic design for comfort, and long-lasting reliability with a three-year warranty. The images provided by the seller align with the described sleek and functional black optical mouse. The buyer review, however, notes a specific instance where the mouse ceased to function after approximately one year and ten months, which falls within the three-year warranty period promised by the seller.The buyer's dissatisfaction stems from the product's failure before the warranty expired, which would have ideally been addressed through warranty service. Since the seller offers a warranty explicitly, the failure of the mouse before the end of the warranty period indicates a lapse in product reliability or service. If the warranty was not honored as expected, this would constitute a fault on the seller's end for not aligning with their guarantee.In conclusion, the buyer's dissatisfaction is justified, as the mouse stopped functioning prematurely despite being within the warranty period, and the seller is at fault if warranty support was inadequate or unavailable. The product otherwise appears to meet the specifications and functionality described by the seller, with the failure being an individual defect rather than a widespread issue.",
