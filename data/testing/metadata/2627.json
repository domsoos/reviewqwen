    "review": "The microfiber cloths feel rough and scratch delicate surfaces like mirrors.",
    "Expected-output": "The seller's description and images emphasize the cloths being scratch-free and ideal for delicate surfaces like mirrors. The buyer's image and review contradict this claim by showing scratches on a mirror, highlighting a quality issue. This mismatch points to the seller being at fault for not delivering the advertised scratch-free performance.",
