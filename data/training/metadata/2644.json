    "review": "The LED supply indicator stopped working after just a week, making it hard to tell if the strip is powered.",
    "Expected-output": "The seller's description mentions a reliable LED indicator to display power status. However, the buyer's review and image showing a non-functional indicator contradict the promised quality. This fault lies with the product's durability and functionality, as the seller's claims are not consistent with the buyer's experience. The dissatisfaction is a result of product failure, making the seller responsible.",
