Product details: Package Dimensions : 10.93 x 8.46 x 7.87 inches; 1 Pounds. UPC : 052000050646. Manufacturer : PepsiCO. ASIN : B09NMQ323Y. Country of Origin : USA",
    "review": "Ordered lemon flavor and waited a month to get a package that said lemon on the outside package but had black cherry bottles in it",
    "expected-output": "Seller Description: The description specifies a variety pack for Propel Immune Support, mentioning flavors like Lemon Blackberry, Orange Raspberry, and Pineapple Peach. The seller image also shows individual 12-pack bottles for each flavor, including lemon flavor. Buyer Image: The buyer's image clearly displays a 12-pack of Propel labeled as lemon but contains bottles of black cherry flavor instead. Buyer Review: The buyer expressed dissatisfaction, noting they ordered the lemon flavor but received black cherry bottles inside a package labeled as lemon. They had waited a month for this order, adding to their frustration. Discrepancies and Satisfaction: Discrepancy: The outer package label reads \"Lemon,\" as expected based on the order. However, the bottles inside are of a different flavor (black cherry), suggesting a packing or labeling error from the supplier. Buyer Satisfaction: The buyer is dissatisfied due to receiving the wrong product flavor after an extended wait. This issue directly relates to the fulfillment of the order rather than the product's quality. Conclusion: The fault lies with the seller or packager for the mismatch between the label on the outer package and the actual contents. This discrepancy affects the buyer\u2019s satisfaction with the purchasing experience, as they did not receive the ordered flavor despite correct labeling on the packaging. In this case, the fault lies with the seller or packager due to the mismatch between the outer package label (which correctly reads \"Lemon\") and the actual contents (black cherry flavor). This error directly impacts the buyer's satisfaction, especially given the long wait for the order. The issue relates to the order fulfillment process rather than the product's quality itself.",
