    "review": "Had an older Eufy model that didn't have any mapping and just used the bump technology. This one is lightyears ahead with the lidar and room mapping. Still have to regularly vacuum our shag throw rug as it is too high, but I'll take it. We have one large older dog and two cats, so plenty of pet hair to go around. This makes it way more manageable by running it daily. Has plenty of battery life to do our 2000 Sq ft ranch. The self emptying feature also is great, you can run it and forget it. Super easy to setup, ran the room mapping and threw in my no go zones around pet water dishes and corded areas, and ran it right away. Haven't had any issues yet. It is loud when it self empties, but again it's expected and saving me time. Hopefully it lasts a few years before we have to swap it out, but so far so good!2000 square foot ranchLvp floors throughout with area rugs1 dog 2 cats\u200b",

The buyer's review affirms these claims, praising its efficiency in managing pet hair and daily cleaning across their 2000 sq. ft. ranch. They appreciated the seamless setup, precise mapping, and self-emptying functionality, though noted its loud noise during emptying as expected. The buyer also mentioned its inability to clean higher rugs, which aligns with the product's suitability for low-profile surfaces as described. Both seller and buyer convey a product that meets expectations and excels in convenience, functionality, and performance. Here, the seller delivered as promised, and the buyer expressed satisfaction, indicating no fault on either side.",
