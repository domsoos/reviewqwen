Disposable for convenience, these earplugs are ideal for everyday use. For detailed fitting instructions, please refer to the attached manual.",
    "review": "The earplugs do not block as much sound as expected. Only if you roll the plug and press it deep into the ear, it works ok. However, it isn't comfortable to wear this for long periods. I had bought them for studying/sleeping as there is a lot of noise from airplanes flying over my building due to which my parents aren't able to sleep well at night.",
    "expected-output": "The seller describes the earplugs as having a Noise Reduction Rating (NRR) of 29 decibels, designed for ear protection, travel noise reduction, and sleeping. The buyer's review highlights that the earplugs do not block as much sound as expected unless inserted deeply, which makes them uncomfortable for extended wear. The buyer had purchased them to reduce noise from airplanes but found them ineffective unless pressed deeply, causing discomfort. While the productâ€™s design aligns with the seller's description, the buyer is dissatisfied with the earplugs' performance, primarily due to their insufficient noise-blocking ability and discomfort for long-term use. The fault seems to lie with the product's performance, which did not meet the buyer's expectations for noise reduction and comfort.",
