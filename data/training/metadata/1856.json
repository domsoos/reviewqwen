    "expected-output": "The seller's description states that the adhesive tape offers excellent holding power, is suitable for various applications, and adheres to slightly irregular surfaces. It is non-toxic and conforms to ASTM D-4236 standards, providing a safe and reliable solution for packaging and sealing. The buyer's review expresses dissatisfaction, stating that the delivered product was a transparent tape, while the product description and image suggested something different. This discrepancy suggests that the buyer expected a product that matched the visual representation in the listing but received something else. The buyer appears dissatisfied due to this mismatch, and the fault seems to lie with the sellerâ€™s misleading product image or description.",
