    "expected-output":"The seller describes the vegetable and fruit chopper as a durable and efficient product made from unbreakable ABS plastic with a unique string function for effortless chopping. It features a sturdy 3-blade stainless steel design and is marketed as eco-friendly, sleek, compact, and dishwasher-safe. The seller’s images showcase a chopper with a transparent body, blue lid, and a pull-string mechanism, aligning with the product’s described attributes. However, the buyer’s review expresses dissatisfaction, claiming the product received is of inferior quality and does not match the seller’s images. Specifically, the buyer notes that the lid received has a screw fitting, unlike the advertised design, and describes it as delicate and fragile compared to a previously purchased version from an offline store. The buyer’s image supports these claims, showing a product inconsistent with the advertised design.This discrepancy highlights a significant issue of product misrepresentation, where the seller appears to have provided an item differing from the advertised product. The fault lies with the seller for failing to deliver the correct product as per the description and images, leading to justified buyer dissatisfaction. The buyer’s complaint is valid as they expected the advertised robust product but received a substandard and mismatched item instead.",
