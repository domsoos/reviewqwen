    "review": "The package arrived in a box that seemed to have been mishandled, and there was salt everywhere inside.",
    "Expected-output": "The buyer\u2019s dissatisfaction stems from the shipping or packaging process. The seller description emphasizes purity and hygiene, and while the salt itself may still retain these qualities, the buyer's image suggests mishandling or inadequate protective measures. Fault lies with the seller for not ensuring secure delivery packaging.",
