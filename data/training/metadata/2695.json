    "review": "The dumbbells have a very strong chemical smell, making them difficult to use indoors. This was not mentioned anywhere in the description.",
    "Expected-output": "The seller's description highlights the use of high-quality materials but does not mention any issues with odors. The buyer's review about a strong chemical smell suggests a flaw in the product that was not disclosed. While the images do not provide direct evidence of the issue, the discrepancy lies in the description. Here, the seller is at fault for not providing complete information about the product.",
