    "review": "It cleans literally nothing and the footwear looks same as before. Don't recommend to anyone.",
    "expected-output": "The seller promotes TCCO disposable shoe cleaner wipes as a highly effective solution for removing dirt, grime, and stains from various materials like nylon, canvas, suede, and leather, claiming the product restores footwear and cleans accessories like leather bags. However, the buyer expresses complete dissatisfaction, stating that the wipes have no cleaning effect and leave shoes unchanged, directly contradicting the seller's claims. Images likely highlight this discrepancy, with the seller showcasing pristine results and the buyer showing no visible improvement. This significant mismatch suggests that the product fails to deliver on its core promise, with the fault lying with the seller for overstating its capabilities and creating misleading expectations.",
