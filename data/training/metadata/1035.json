    "expected-output": "The seller presents the Boldfit Hand Gripper as a versatile adjustable resistance strengthener with a range of 10-60 kg, suitable for fitness enthusiasts, musicians, and individuals aiming to improve grip strength, wrist flexibility, and finger muscles. The product is described as durable, featuring high-quality stainless steel springs, a non-slip handle, and a compact design, making it suitable for gym, home, or office use. The seller emphasizes long-lasting usability and silent operation for convenience. The seller's images align with the description, showcasing a sleek gripper with adjustable resistance markings and robust construction.The buyer's review, however, reflects dissatisfaction, stating that the product exhibited defects within less than a month of use and emphasizes that the return period expired before the issue arose. The buyer's image supports their claim, showing multiple units of the gripper, suggesting potential manufacturing flaws or quality control issues that contradict the seller's assurance of durability and high-quality materials.While the product’s initial appearance and functionality might align with the seller’s claims, the reported defect within a short usage period highlights a significant inconsistency with the durability and quality advertised. The buyer's dissatisfaction is justified, as the product did not meet the promised standards of longevity and reliability. The fault lies with the seller or manufacturer for failing to ensure consistent quality, which led to a substandard experience for the buyer. This case underscores the importance of stringent quality control to maintain trust and satisfaction among customers.",
