    "seller_description": "The latest head-light series from Yonex, NANORAY provides a fast and controlled swing with enhanced repulsion via the New Aero Frame. NANORAY is designed for players who force their opponents into the back of the court with extreme speed. The thinner top of the frame sides minimize air resistance for greater head speed, while the thicker sides at the bottom of the head generate maximum repulsion through greater frame stiffness. NANOMESH + CARBON NANOTUBE - New from YONEX: Nanomesh + Carbon Nanotube is an exclusive structural material inserted into the frame and/or shaft of the nanoray series. It significantly increases repulsion power, toughness and impact strength within the racquet. By combining carbon nanotube with a resin, the two molecules create a mesh-like construction which delivers a head-light racquet, sharper drive shots, improved strength and faster handling. ISOMETRIC - The square-shaped ISOMETRIC frame shape is designed to keep vertical strings at a similar length, as well as the horizontal strings to produce an expanded sweet spot in all directions. AERO Frame - Decreases air resistance and realizes a quicker swing. TFA CAP - Provides extra shaft flex to accelerate frame recovery after impact. Also provides vibration dampening along with a comfortable fit on your thumb.",

Its lightweight frame and sleek isometric design allowed me to experiment with dynamic shadow effects in my studio.
