    "review": "The heart looks cute when assembled, but the stand isn\u2019t as stable as I hoped. It tends to wobble a bit on uneven surfaces, though it\u2019s fine on flat ones.",
    "Expected_output": "The buyer appreciates the aesthetic value but highlights a minor stability issue with the stand, which reflects personal experience rather than a flaw in the design.",
