    "review": "I bought this toothbrush to clean my shoes. I was looking for something to scrub my sneakers with, and this did the job! The handle is comfortable, and the brush head is sturdy enough for the rougher material of my shoes. I don t think it would work well for teeth, but for shoe cleaning, it works just fine.",
    "expected-output": "Seller's Description vs. Buyer’s Review: The seller describes the AquaSonic Black Series Smart Toothbrush as a high-performance electric toothbrush designed for human oral care. With features like 40,000 vibrations per minute, four brushing modes, and eight DuPont-engineered brush heads, the product is marketed to deliver superior oral hygiene. The product is waterproof, ergonomic, and includes a custom travel case, offering convenience and portability. The focus is on cleaning teeth, improving gum health, and providing an overall modern, high-tech brushing experience. The buyer, however, uses the toothbrush for an entirely different purpose—cleaning their shoes. Instead of using it for its intended purpose of oral care, the buyer applies the product to scrub sneakers, commenting on the toothbrush's suitability for that task. The review is completely irrelevant to the seller's description and provides no feedback on the product’s effectiveness for teeth cleaning. Discrepancy: The buyer’s review does not align with the seller's description, as the toothbrush is marketed for oral hygiene, yet the buyer uses it for an unrelated task, cleaning shoes. The review does not discuss the key features related to oral care, such as the brushing modes, effectiveness in cleaning teeth, or comfort for human use. Conclusion: The review does not provide useful or relevant feedback regarding the product’s performance for its intended use—oral care. Instead, it discusses an unrelated application for the toothbrush, making the review unhelpful for customers evaluating the product for its intended purpose. The buyer’s comments do not address any of the critical aspects of the product, such as brushing effectiveness, battery life, or cleaning modes. The fault lies with the buyer in this case. The review is irrelevant to the seller’s description and fails to provide useful feedback on the product’s functionality for human oral care. This misalignment makes the review unhelpful for potential customers who are considering the product for its intended use in maintaining oral hygiene.\" }",
