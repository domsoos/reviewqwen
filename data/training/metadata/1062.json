    "review": "So Basically the air tag is not a Solution for finding items which are beyond the range or perimeter of air tag and iphone.The item can be only located if its a near to a distance of 10-15 meters only.Also the beep sound is too low which can be only heard in complete silence.Cannot be used as A PET tracker at all.Also sometimes it wont be able to located the air tag so you must be a closer distance within the Bluetooth of the air tag and your phone.Little pricy as well since apples are expensive than oranges.",
    "expected-output":"The provided seller description highlights the Apple AirTag's key features, including effortless tracking through the Find My app, Precision Finding with Ultra Wideband technology for nearby tracking, and the use of Apple's extensive device network for locating distant items. It emphasizes privacy, with encrypted communication, and promotes its compatibility with various iPhone models and Siri integration for convenience. The seller images match the description, showcasing the sleek design of the AirTag, which aligns with the advertised product. However, the buyer's review presents significant limitations in functionality, such as the AirTag's limited range of 10-15 meters for effective tracking and its low-volume beep sound, which is challenging to hear except in complete silence. The buyer also criticizes its unsuitability as a pet tracker and notes occasional difficulties in locating the AirTag even within Bluetooth range. Additionally, the buyer perceives the AirTag as overpriced relative to its utility. These criticisms suggest dissatisfaction with the product's practical usability, even though the item aligns visually with the seller's promise. While the seller's description is accurate in its technical claims, it omits practical constraints that may impact user expectations. The fault appears to lie with the seller for not adequately managing buyer expectations by clearly specifying the limitations of range and sound volume, which are critical for effective use.",
