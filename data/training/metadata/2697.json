    "seller_description": "This semi-automatic top-loading washer comes ready to use with no installation or demo required, and all features are detailed in the included user manual. Equipped with a powerful 270 W motor and hydrologic pulsator, it generates a strong water flow for efficient cleaning. With a 6.5 kg capacity, it is ideal for families of 3 to 4 members. The washer offers two wash programs and comes with a 1-year comprehensive warranty and an additional 6-year warranty on the motor, ensuring durability and reliability.",
    "review": "The washer makes a lot of noise and vibrates excessively, which is very annoying. It is not suitable for delicate clothes as they get tangled during the wash cycle.",
    "Expected-output": "The review indicates dissatisfaction with the product due to noise and vibrations. However, the seller's description clearly specifies a powerful 270 W motor and hydrologic pulsator for efficient cleaning, which may account for the vibrations. The buyer's image of the washer aligns with the seller's images in terms of appearance and features. The tangling of clothes might be a user handling issue rather than a product defect. Thus, the fault does not lie with the seller as the product appears to be delivered as promised.",
