    "review": "I bought these to set out at a Celebration of Life for my aunt - she loved the Little Debbie Oatmeal Pies. But when I opened the first box, they were all smushed and discolored. Second and third boxes were the same. The last box was the only box I feel look good enough to set out.",
    "expected-output": "Product Description & Seller Image: The seller describes Little Debbie Oatmeal Creme Pies as classic treats made with whole grain oats, molasses, and a creme filling. The treats are marketed as being a satisfying snack for over 60 years. The product images provided by the seller display fresh, intact creme pies with a smooth texture and well-defined creme filling, conveying a high-quality appearance. Buyer Images & Review: The buyer\u2019s images reveal discolored, flattened, and damaged oatmeal creme pies. Instead of the fresh appearance shown in the seller's images, these treats appear compressed and lack the visual appeal expected from the description. The buyer mentions that only one out of four boxes had pies that looked decent enough for a public display at a memorial event, leading to dissatisfaction due to poor presentation. Assessment: Appearance Discrepancy: There\u2019s a significant difference between the seller\u2019s polished images and the buyer\u2019s experience, as the buyer received smashed, discolored pies instead of intact and visually appealing ones. Functionality: The buyer had specific intentions for a memorial event, expecting the pies to look presentable. The poor condition of the product did not meet this need, leading to disappointment. Conclusion: The buyer is dissatisfied with the product due to its poor condition upon arrival. The discrepancy likely stems from handling or packaging issues during transit or storage. This issue is not related to buyer opinion but rather an unmet expectation based on the seller's advertised quality, suggesting a failure in either packaging robustness or shipping care by the seller or courier.\" The fault in this situation lies primarily with the seller or courier service, as the product arrived in a condition that did not match the quality and appearance shown in the seller's description and images. The damage to the pies likely occurred due to insufficient packaging or mishandling during transit, which led to the buyer's dissatisfaction, especially since they intended the treats for a public event. The seller may need to consider more protective packaging to prevent such issues in future deliveries.",
