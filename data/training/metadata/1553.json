    "seller_description": "Whiskas Adult Wet Cat Food (1+ years) provides 100% complete and balanced nutrition for your cat. Available in a delicious Tuna in Jelly flavor, this cat food features a jelly texture and aroma that appeals to even the fussiest eaters. Made with real fish and enriched with healthy ingredients, vitamins, and minerals, it supports your cat\u2019s overall health. With high moisture content, it helps keep your cat hydrated while being easy to eat and digest. Additionally, it contains quality protein for healthy muscles, Omega-6 and Zinc for a shiny coat, and antioxidants to support natural defense.",
    "review": "The product is good. Amazon mentions 112 sachets i.e. 8 boxes with 14 sachets. The whiskas carton contains 8 boxes with 12 sachets each. This works out to only 96 sachets in total. This is my third order. The first two orders contained 14 sachets in each box but this one only 12 in each. Amazon needs to take this up with the seller. As a customer, I feel cheated. Customer care was even unhelpful.",
    "expected-output": "The seller describes Whiskas Adult Wet Cat Food as a high-quality product providing complete and balanced nutrition for adult cats, with features like a delicious Tuna in Jelly flavor, high moisture content for hydration, and added nutrients for a shiny coat, healthy muscles, and overall well-being. However, the buyer\u2019s review reveals dissatisfaction due to a mismatch in the number of sachets promised and delivered. The seller\u2019s description does not explicitly mention the quantity of sachets, but the buyer received 96 sachets instead of the 112 expected based on prior orders and Amazon's listing, leading to feelings of being cheated. Despite being satisfied with the product quality, the discrepancy in quantity and unhelpful customer care significantly impacted the buyer\u2019s experience. The fault lies with either the seller or the platform for inconsistent product quantity and poor communication, requiring immediate resolution to regain customer trust",
