    "review": "It's a normal 100 rs winter woollen cap. Still wondering why they are charging 275% of its price. If it's intentional, certainly it's extremely overpriced. Check in some local stores, you can get it for below 100 rs also.",
    "expected-output": " The seller describes the Slovic Resistance Tubes as premium fitness equipment made from natural Malaysian latex, designed for durability, elasticity, and versatility in targeting various muscle groups, complete with door anchors and a training guide for home workouts. However, the buyerâ€™s review refers to receiving a winter woolen cap, indicating a potential miscommunication or delivery error. The buyer expresses dissatisfaction with the perceived overpricing of the received item, which does not align with the advertised product. This discrepancy suggests that the fault lies with the seller, as the delivered product does not match the description, leading to a negative customer experience.",
