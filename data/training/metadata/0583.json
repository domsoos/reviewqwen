    "expected-output": "Seller's Description: The seller's description highlights the classic appeal of Little Debbie Oatmeal Creme Pies, stating they are made with whole grain oats, molasses, and creme filling. The snack has a long-standing reputation and is advertised as fresh and high-quality, with the company promising \"Quality, freshness, and taste.\" Seller's Images: The seller's images display fresh, well-shaped Oatmeal Creme Pies with a uniform, appetizing appearance, reinforcing the expectation of quality and freshness. Buyer’s Review: The buyer expresses dissatisfaction, noting that the “best if used by” date on the product was March 7, 2024, yet they received the item after this date, on March 15, 2024. This detail raises concerns about the freshness of the product, directly contradicting the seller’s promise of quality and freshness. Buyer’s Images: The buyer’s images confirm the expired date on the packaging, which aligns with their complaint. This discrepancy further highlights a quality control issue from the seller's side, as the buyer received a product past its suggested consumption date. Discrepancies: Quality Control Issue: The product was shipped to the buyer after its \"best by\" date, undermining the seller's claims of \"quality, freshness, and taste.\" Expectation vs. Reality: The buyer’s expectation of receiving a fresh product, based on the seller's description and reputation, was unmet, leading to dissatisfaction. Conclusion: The buyer is dissatisfied due to the product being shipped past its \"best by\" date, which reflects a fault on the seller's part in managing stock and ensuring product freshness. This experience conflicts with the seller's promise of high quality and freshness, suggesting a need for improved quality checks before shipment.\" The fault in this case lies with the seller, as they failed to meet their promise of quality and freshness by shipping a product past its \"best by\" date. The discrepancy between the advertised freshness and the expired product the buyer received undermines the buyer's confidence in the seller's quality control practices. This experience indicates a need for the seller to enhance their stock management and quality checks to ensure only fresh products are shipped to customers.",
