    "review": "It is damaged. See the photo. I was on a trip and cannot check the package in time. So the return window is closed.Sure the material is of poor quality.",
    "expected-output": "The buyer's review highlights significant dissatisfaction with the product, as the suitcase arrived damaged, which the buyer attributes to poor material quality. The seller's description emphasized the suitcase's features like durability, ample space, and smooth maneuverability, which the buyer may have initially found appealing. However, the damaged condition of the suitcase, combined with the inability to return the item due to the closed return window, led to frustration. The issue of poor material quality points to a discrepancy between the seller's description and the actual product experience. The fault lies with the seller's quality control or the handling of the product, as the buyer received a damaged item that did not meet expectations for durability.",
