    "review": "The lamp stopped working within a week of use. Even the warranty claim process is a nightmare and not worth the effort.",
    "Expected-output": "The buyer is dissatisfied with the lamp's durability and the warranty process, which starkly contrasts the seller's claims of reliability and hassle-free warranty service. The provided images do not demonstrate these issues visually, but the description points to a fault on the seller's part for quality and service failure.",
