    "review": "This has to be the worst delivery I've seen in my life. The box has a rotten stench, the packets were open and there were maggots! This was traumatic. Threw the complete box, hopefully replacement won't be same.",
    "expected-output": "The seller describes Whiskas Adult Wet Cat Food as a nutritious and hydrating meal for adult cats, promising 100% complete and balanced nutrition with benefits like a healthy coat, better digestion, and enhanced muscle health. However, the buyerâ€™s experience was highly negative, citing severe delivery issues with open packets, a rotten stench, and maggots in the product, leading them to discard the entire package. This indicates significant lapses in packaging or storage that failed to uphold the seller's quality promises. The fault lies with the seller for not ensuring proper handling and delivery conditions, leading to a disappointing customer experience",
