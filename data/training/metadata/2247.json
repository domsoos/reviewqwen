    "seller_description": "The upgraded motion sensor under cabinet lights offer enhanced functionality with auto-on motion detection within 120\u00b0 and 10ft in dark or low-light environments, automatically turning off after about 20 seconds of no movement. This eliminates the need to fumble for switches in the dark, preventing accidents. Additionally, these lights can be set to always-on mode for continuous use during the day or for tasks like reading, camping, or as a flashlight. Featuring 40 energy-efficient LEDs and a non-glare frosted cover, these dimmable lights offer 5 brightness levels, providing flexibility for both bright task lighting and softer night lighting without disturbing others. The lights are USB-C rechargeable with a built-in 1800mAh battery, offering up to 30 days of use in motion sensor mode or 8 hours in always-on mode at full brightness. With easy installation via strong magnets or adhesive metal plates, they\u2019re perfect for use in the kitchen, closets, cupboards, pantry, basement, stairs, hallways, and more, with no need for an electrician.",
