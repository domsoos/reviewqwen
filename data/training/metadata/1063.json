    "expected-output": "The Apple AirTag as per the seller's description offers seamless integration with the Find My app, featuring Ultra Wideband technology for Precision Finding, compatibility with the Apple ecosystem, and a privacy-centric design. The provided seller's images depict a sleek and compact device consistent with Apple's minimalist aesthetic. However, the buyer's review highlights critical limitations, notably the restricted range of 10-15 meters, insufficient beep sound volume, and unreliable tracking capability beyond Bluetooth proximity. Additionally, the buyer mentions functional inadequacies such as lack of updates and dependency on light for performance, which are not mentioned in the seller's description. The buyer also expresses dissatisfaction with the product's utility as a pet tracker and finds it overpriced. While the seller's description aligns with the product's intended design and features, the buyer's feedback suggests a discrepancy in expectations versus real-world utility. The buyer's dissatisfaction stems from both the product's inherent design constraints and possibly an overestimation of its capabilities based on the seller's promotional narrative. The fault, in this case, appears to partially lie with the seller for not explicitly clarifying the product's limitations and partially with the buyer for possibly expecting functionalities beyond the stated capabilities.",
