    "review": "Walking into a Bass Pro or any other sporting store and looking at their nets, they're expensive! This net is excellent and at this price, it cannot be beat.First thing to mention is that it is light weight but extremely durable. It has a metal frame around even the basket, which most others on the market do not.It has a really comfortable grip on the handle, it can extend and even fold down into something small enough to clip on a backpack (clip included).Lastly, I must mention the net which has this material built into it that if you drop it in the water, it will float! Not only that but the net itself has what feels like a coating (see pictures) which prevents fish and hooks getting tangled in it.All in all this is a great net, whether you're kayaking, doing a small lightweight backpacking fishing trip, or if you have a full on decked out boat.",
