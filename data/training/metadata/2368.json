You get a charging cable, a double usb-c cable and an hdmi to mini-hdmi cable.Innovative stand, taking notes from tablets, works well.

    "Expected_output": "The seller's description of the KYY 15.6-Inch FHD 1080P Portable Monitor highlights its advanced IPS screen with 1920x1080 resolution, HDR technology, and a 178\u00b0 wide viewing angle, promoting its suitability for gaming and multimedia. It emphasizes features like eye-care technology, dual USB Type-C and Mini-HDMI compatibility, ultra-slim design, lightweight portability, built-in stereo speakers, and a durable PU leather smart cover. The buyer's review confirms many of these claims, praising the monitor's easy setup, good color gamut, durable stand, included high-quality cables, and seamless connectivity with devices like the Steam Deck. The buyer also appreciates the lack of eye strain and the sturdy, innovative stand design. The seller's images align with the buyer's, as both showcase the monitor's sleek appearance and functional design. However, the buyer notes slightly tinny audio, which is a minor shortcoming not mentioned in the description but doesn't detract significantly from overall satisfaction. Based on the review and images, the buyer appears satisfied, aligning with the seller's promises, and there are no significant discrepancies to attribute fault to either party.",
