    "review": "They are really nice and worth the price but instead of 100 piece I got 99Very durable and exact size ( I ordered 8x12 inches)",
    "expected-output": "The seller describes the polybags as durable, self-adhesive, tear-resistant, and waterproof, available in different pack sizes with a material thickness of 240 gauge. The buyer acknowledges the product's durability and correct size but mentions receiving 99 bags instead of the expected 100, which is a minor discrepancy in the quantity. There is no issue with the product's quality or performance, but the discrepancy in quantity suggests a packaging error on the seller's part. The fault lies with the seller for not fulfilling the correct quantity in the order.",
