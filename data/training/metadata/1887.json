    "review": "Worst product, I got latic allergic after using this product. Plz don\u2019t buy this product. I am going to file a suit against this product",
    "expected-output": "The seller's description highlights the Alitmun Latex Examination Gloves as durable, comfortable, and suitable for various environments, with a focus on ease of use and protection. The buyer's review expresses a strong dissatisfaction with the product, stating that they developed a latex allergy after using it and recommending against purchasing it. The issue raised by the buyer pertains to an allergic reaction, which is a personal health concern. While the seller's description does not explicitly mention potential allergens like latex, it is important to note that latex gloves are known to cause allergic reactions in some individuals. In this case, the fault does not lie with the seller for the product's quality or description, but rather with the buyer's personal allergic reaction to latex. However, the buyer's negative experience highlights the importance of clear product labeling regarding potential allergens, which could help prevent such reactions.",
