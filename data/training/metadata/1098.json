    "expected-output": "The seller's description presents the Aurion punching bag as a high-quality product made from premium synthetic leather with a water-resistant finish and reinforced stitching for durability. It is advertised as a 4ft punching bag with a weight of approximately 20kg when filled, complete with 12oz gloves and a hanging chain for easy setup. The description emphasizes its multi-layer construction, filled with shredded cloth for durability, and highlights its suitability for various combat sports and fitness activities. The promotional image further conveys quality with features like a premium zipper and enhanced stability through a sturdy hanging system.The buyer's review, however, highlights dissatisfaction due to the punching bag being delivered unfilled, despite the description implying otherwise. While the buyer acknowledges the quality of other aspects of the product, the unfilled state of the bag contradicts the implied expectation set by the seller's description. The image provided by the buyer shows the punching bag in an unfilled and flattened state, which does not match the filled and functional appearance depicted in the seller's promotional material.In conclusion, the buyer's dissatisfaction is valid as the seller's description created an expectation that the punching bag would be delivered filled, which was not the case. The fault lies with the seller for not clearly specifying in the description that the bag would be delivered unfilled, leading to a mismatch between buyer expectations and the actual product received. While the product quality appears to align with the description, the lack of clarity on this critical detail undermines the buyer's experience.",
