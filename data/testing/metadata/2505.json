    "review": "The frames feel cheaply made, and the TR90 material doesn't seem durable at all. I doubt these will last more than a month.",
    "Expected-output": "The seller's description guarantees durable TR90 material, but the buyer's images and feedback suggest that the material quality does not match the promise. The seller is at fault for overstating the product's durability.",
