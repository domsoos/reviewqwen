    "review": "Could hardly connect to my phone twice and then it stopped working like it didn't connect to my phone so I couldn't use it and after 2 or 3 days this fitting came off. And then I went to one plus service centre they said because of this fitting they won't entertain my complaint. After requesting them to look into it they finally replaced it with a new earphone. Thanks for your cooperation",
    "expected-ouput": "The seller’s description highlights the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2's exceptional features, including a quick-charging capability that provides up to 20 hours of playback, high battery life, deep bass, and IP55 water and sweat resistance. The seller's images also showcase the product's design and build quality. The buyer, however, encountered significant issues shortly after purchase. The product initially failed to connect reliably to the buyer’s phone, rendering it largely unusable. Additionally, a part of the earphone's fitting detached, which the OnePlus service center initially used to deny support. After persistence, the buyer was able to secure a replacement, indicating that the service center did resolve the complaint eventually.The product's visual alignment between the seller's and buyer's images is evident, as both show the same model and features. However, the buyer's experience does not align with the seller's description of reliability and durability. The fitting issue and connectivity problems contradict the claims of high performance and robust design. This points to a potential fault in the manufacturing or quality control of the unit received by the buyer.While the service center’s eventual resolution was positive, the initial refusal to entertain the complaint due to a minor defect reflects poorly on customer support. The fauin this case lies primarily with the seller’s product for failing to meet the advertised standards of performance and build quality. However, the seller did ensure resolution through the replacement process, mitigating the dissatisfaction to some extent. The buyer’s persistence also played a role in resolving the issue.",
