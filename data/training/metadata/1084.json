    "review": "I ordered leg and foot massager twice on Amazon both times it was delivered with broken body and erratic functioning. On top of that company shoving off responsibility to delivery agent and customer.",
    "expected-output":"The seller describes the leg and foot massager as an advanced device offering 3 auto programs, 3 customizable manual modes, and features like kneading, vibrating, rolling, and heating for relieving muscle tension and improving blood circulation. It includes an LED display, removable fabric covers, and a 1-year brand warranty, emphasizing durability and functionality. The seller's images depict a robust device with clear instructions and well-advertised features. However, the buyer’s review reports dissatisfaction, stating that the product was delivered twice with a broken body and erratic functioning. The buyer's image corroborates this claim, showing visible cracks on the massager's body, directly conflicting with the seller's claims of durability.This discrepancy highlights significant issues with the product's packaging, quality control, or shipping process, as the device repeatedly arrived damaged. The review also mentions poor post-sales support, with the company refusing to accept responsibility and shifting blame to the delivery agent, exacerbating the buyer’s frustration.Conclusion:The fault lies primarily with the seller for failing to ensure the product's durability during transit and for inadequate quality assurance before shipping. Additionally, the lack of accountability from the seller’s side further contributes to the buyer’s dissatisfaction. The buyer’s complaints are valid, as the product did not meet the advertised durability standards, and the seller's customer service failed to address the issue effectively. This case reflects both product and service shortcomings on the seller's part.",
