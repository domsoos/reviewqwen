    "review": "I liked how classy it looks. The stainless steel style is a must in watches. Beware of the size. This is more of a wirst band that pretends to be a watch. Let's put it like that.It is adjustable, so even skinny men like me have no problem using this watch.The provided manual doesn't explain anything on how to adjust the belt, but go to YouTube and watch a tutorial. You'll find out how to adjust it and it is pretty easy.It beeps every hour and it sounds loud enough.",
