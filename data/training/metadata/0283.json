    "expected-output": "Seller's Description: The product is advertised as a high-quality AV equipment rack made of engineered wood, with dimensions of 25 x 20 x 9 cm. It’s designed to store various electronic devices such as Wi-Fi routers, set-top boxes, gaming consoles, and more. The seller highlights that it includes open storage for better cable management and provides a space-efficient, stylish solution. The description also emphasizes premium features like being insect-proof, scratch-resistant, and made from pre-laminated MDF. All necessary screws for assembly are stated as included in the package. Buyer’s Review: The buyer expresses dissatisfaction, stating that the product arrived with only six screws, even though the manual mentioned ten screws. This missing hardware required the buyer to source additional screws separately, leading to inconvenience and a delay in installation. The buyer also comments that the product length is smaller than expected and doesn’t match the picture provided by the seller. This suggests a discrepancy in expectations regarding the actual dimensions or visual appearance of the item. Visual Comparison: Comparing the seller’s promotional images with the buyer's provided photos, there are visible differences. The structure in the buyer’s image appears slightly different, especially in terms of detailing and possibly in finish quality. This difference may explain the buyer's comment regarding size and appearance. Conclusion: It seems the buyer’s dissatisfaction stems from both the incomplete hardware and the perceived discrepancy in product size and appearance compared to the seller’s promotional images. While the product might technically meet the dimensions listed, the images seem to create an impression of a larger or more robust product. Fault Attribution: The seller is at fault for not ensuring all necessary screws were included, which led to inconvenience. Additionally, the promotional images may have inadvertently set unrealistic expectations for the product's size and appearance, causing the buyer’s disappointment.",
