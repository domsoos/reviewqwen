    "expected-output":"The seller has provided a set of two stainless-steel bowls designed for pets such as puppies, dogs, cats, or kittens, each with a capacity of 700 ml, ideal for feeding and hydration needs. The description emphasizes the bowls being rust-resistant, odor-free, and featuring a rubber base for stability to prevent sliding during meals, with a dishwasher-safe design for easy cleaning. The product images showcase sleek, polished stainless-steel bowls with a sturdy no-tip base, consistent with the description. The buyer's review indicates satisfaction with the product's usability, particularly highlighting that the pet liked it, and the rubber grip functioned well. However, the buyer points out a discrepancy in the material quality, noting that the steel is thinner than expected, which deviates slightly from the implied robustness in the sellerâ€™s description. Despite this, the buyer appreciates the overall aesthetic and finds the product worth purchasing in the given price range, indicating a generally positive but measured response. Fault does not entirely lie with the seller as the product appears to deliver its advertised functionality, but the implied robustness may have been overstated, leading to slight buyer dissatisfaction regarding material thickness.",
