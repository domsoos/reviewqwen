    "expected-output": " The seller advertises Whiskas Junior Kitten Wet Cat Food as a complete and balanced nutritional option designed for kittens aged 2-12 months, featuring real chicken in a gravy texture to appeal to kittens' tastes. The product includes Omega 6 and Zinc for healthy skin and a shiny coat, DHA for brain and eyesight development, and Taurine for healthy vision, along with 41 essential nutrients and quality protein to promote growth and strong muscles. However, the buyer left a brief and negative review stating "Bad experience..," indicating dissatisfaction but without specifying the reason. This contrast between the seller's promises of quality and the buyer's feedback suggests an issue, though the exact problem remains unclear. The seller should engage with the customer to understand the reason for their dissatisfaction, whether related to product quality, packaging, or the kitten's preferences, and provide appropriate support to improve customer trust and satisfaction.",
