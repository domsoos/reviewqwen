The fabric was even nicer than the photos and is a little like seersucker, so wrinkles wont show. The photos are of the shirt right out of the package.There are various nice touches. The provide an extra button attached to the inside label. There is top stitching along the cuffs of the sleeves. And there is a pleat on the back for a skosh more room to move.This is a brand I\u00e2 d not heard of, but the shirt is well made, well designed, and suits my husband well.",
