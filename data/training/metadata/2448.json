    "review": "I had a projector before, however it can only use at night on the wall. This one is so much better! I can project it on my ceiling so I can watch movie or Netflix when I lay on my bed. The size is also smaller than my old one, it will be easy for me to bring along when I travel! It makes family movie nights easier! The features are also more advanced, my nephews love them, they can watch in their room without taking the TV in the living room. Love it!",
