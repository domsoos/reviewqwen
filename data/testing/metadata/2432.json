    "Expected_output": "Based on the seller's description and the buyer's review, the PZOTRUF Automatic Soap Dispenser appears to align with the seller's promises of being touchless, stylish, and capable of dispensing soap accurately with adjustable output levels. The seller's images present a sleek, high-quality product made from brushed aluminum, and the buyer's images confirm the product's initial aesthetic and functionality. However, the buyer expresses dissatisfaction as the dispenser's condition deteriorated significantly within less than a year, as evidenced by their image showing wear and tear. While the seller guarantees durability with IPX4 waterproof technology and a 2-year assurance, the rapid decline in quality suggests a potential shortfall in material or design integrity. Thus, the buyer's dissatisfaction stems from unmet expectations of longevity, and the fault lies with the seller for not delivering on the product's durability claims.",
