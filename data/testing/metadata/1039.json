    "expected-output": "The seller describes the Nivia Storm molded football as a durable, high-quality product designed for versatile use across various surfaces, including hard ground, wet grass, and artificial turf. The ball features a butyl bladder, which is claimed to ensure long-lasting air retention and consistent shape, making it ideal for training and recreational use. The seller's image shows a visually appealing football with a clean design and bold graphics, aligning well with the product description.The buyer’s review indicates dissatisfaction due to the absence of a nozzle required for inflating the football. This omission made the ball unusable upon arrival, especially problematic since it was intended as a gift and could not be replaced or returned. The buyer's image highlights this issue, focusing on the missing nozzle component, which directly contradicts the product's usability claims. While the ball itself visually matches the seller's description and images, the failure to include an essential accessory significantly diminishes its functionality.This discrepancy clearly places the fault with the seller or manufacturer, as they failed to ensure the inclusion of all necessary components for the product's intended use. The buyer’s dissatisfaction is justified, as the omission of the nozzle has rendered the product incomplete and unsuitable for immediate use. To avoid such issues in the future, the seller should implement stricter quality control and packaging checks to ensure all essential parts are included, thereby enhancing customer satisfaction and trust.",
