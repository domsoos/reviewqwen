    "seller_description": "This high-quality mini keyboard features 120 voices (including 8 Indian voices) and 114 auto-accompaniment styles, along with the Smart Chord function, which includes 10 Indian styles for a rich and versatile playing experience. It also comes with 30 onboard songs, perfect for practice and performance, and includes a free digital songbook to enhance your musical journey.",
    "review": "One white and one black keys are not working in this piano. Please exchange this if possible",
    "expected-output": "The buyer expresses dissatisfaction with the mini keyboard, noting that two keys (one white and one black) are not functioning and requests an exchange. This issue contrasts with the seller's description, which emphasizes the high quality of the keyboard and its suitability for beginners, with features such as 120 voices, 114 auto-accompaniment styles, and the Smart Chord function. The product’s visual representation in the seller's image appears consistent with the buyer's image, suggesting no discrepancy in the product’s appearance. However, the buyer’s complaint about malfunctioning keys indicates a potential defect in the product, which may point to a quality control issue at the manufacturing stage, rather than a problem with the seller's description. The buyer is dissatisfied due to the functionality issue, and this seems to be a fault with the product rather than a misunderstanding or misalignment with the seller’s advertised features. Therefore, the fault lies with the product's quality, not the seller’s description or the buyer’s expectations. The seller should address the issue, likely through an exchange or repair, as per the buyer's request.",
