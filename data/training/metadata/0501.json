The buyer mentions that the material and fit are nice, suggesting that they appreciated the fabric feel and design but were disappointed by the appearance caused by the creases. Image Comparison and Discrepancies: Seller's Image: The camisole appears smooth, well-fitted, and wrinkle-free, presenting a sleek, elegant look. Buyer's Image: The camisole in the buyer\u2019s photo has visible, deep creases that detract from the intended smooth appearance, consistent with the buyer's complaint about the unremovable creases. Conclusion: The buyer\u2019s dissatisfaction stems from the product\u2019s appearance upon delivery, which does not align with the smooth, sleek look shown in the seller\u2019s image. Although the fabric quality and fit meet expectations, the persistent creasing prevents the buyer from wearing the camisole as intended. This discrepancy suggests a gap between the product\u2019s actual and advertised state, likely due to packaging or fabric handling issues. The fault here lies with the seller, as the product did not arrive in a wearable condition.The fault lies with the seller, as the product did not arrive in a wearable condition due to persistent creases that the buyer could not remove, which did not align with the advertised smooth appearance.",
