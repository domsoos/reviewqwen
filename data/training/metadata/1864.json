    "review": "I used 20 rupees local tape to secure my power spike under my desk and it lasted 3 hours.. even using multiple strips it couldn’t hold it.. but this tape made my life simpler.. it comes with the primer and you can just tell it’s a quality product just by looking at it! Clean the surface before applying the primer on both items you want to stick and hold it for 2-4 mins and boom done",
