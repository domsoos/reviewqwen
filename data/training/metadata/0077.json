    "review": "I received a different color than expected and it doesn't fit in my toothbrush holder. Additionally, the motor is too noisy for my liking. Overall, it works, but I just expected more. I also wish the bristles were softer as they feel a little rougher than I prefer.",
    "expected-output": "The review highlights several points of dissatisfaction with the toothbrush, such as receiving the wrong color, difficulties with fitting it into a toothbrush holder, and the motor being too loud. While the product functions, the buyer expresses disappointment with the bristles being rougher than expected. These concerns do not align with the seller’s claims, especially regarding comfort and the features of the toothbrush. In this case, the fault likely lies with the seller, as the buyer did not receive the product as expected (wrong color) and had issues with the product's comfort and usability. The motor noise and bristle texture issues suggest that the product did not meet the buyer’s expectations based on the description, leading to dissatisfaction. Therefore, the seller is at fault for not delivering a product that aligned with the buyer’s expectations.",
