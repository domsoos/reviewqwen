    "expected-output": "Seller's Description Analysis: The seller describes this camisole as: Made of 95% polyester and 5% spandex for a soft, satin-like texture. Designed with a V-neck and adjustable spaghetti straps to enhance the neckline and collarbone. Suggested as a versatile top for casual or formal wear, with a sleek and stylish look. Buyer's Review Analysis: The buyer mentions that while the camisole is visually appealing, it does not fit ideally in the chest area: The camisole fits too tightly in the breast area, despite being loose in other areas. The buyer bought a size Large, with a bra size of 36D and a waist of 33/34 inches. Overall, the buyer rates it a 3 out of 5, indicating partial satisfaction but noting fit issues. Image Comparison and Discrepancies: Seller's Image: The camisole appears smooth, well-fitting, and relaxed, especially around the bust area. The satin material looks sleek and flowy, highlighting a comfortable and flattering fit. Buyer's Image: The camisole shows tension in the bust area, confirming the buyer's complaint about tightness. While the satin material and pattern align with the seller\u2019s image, the fit does not match the relaxed look in the seller\u2019s photo, especially for the buyer\u2019s bust size. Conclusion: The buyer\u2019s main issue is the fit around the bust, which does not align with the relaxed fit shown in the seller\u2019s image. This discrepancy may indicate that the camisole runs slightly smaller in the chest area than expected for individuals with larger busts, even in the Large size. The buyers dissatisfaction is specific to the fit rather than the quality or appearance of the material, suggesting a need for clearer sizing guidance from the seller. The product partially aligns with the seller's promises but falls short in terms of fit, leading to a mixed experience for the buyer.\" The seller is not at fault due to unclear sizing guidance, leading to a fit issue for the buyer in the chest area despite the overall quality and appearance meeting expectations.",
