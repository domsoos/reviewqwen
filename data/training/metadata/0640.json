    "review": "Do you have an insect problem? Do you like to sit outside, but you don't because of the pests that swarm you? The answer to your most annoying problems is here! It's called The Zapper! I purchased this item because of a fruit fly problem. I purchased the medium size (see pics attached). It's hand held. It feels like a tennis racket. It's incredibly lightweight! The red indicator light shows you that the zapper is turned on and ready to use. The blue LED light is to help you see in darker areas. This way you will be sure not to miss those pesky little insects. You just swat at them, or lay the racket upon a surface when they land, and ZAP! They're gone! It takes seconds! It does make a little noise, but nothing terrible. It does spark a little, but it's not bad. It just takes a little getting used to. It is rechargeable. It charges with a USB cable that is included (but only one cable for both rackets). It can be used indoors or outdoors. It takes care of tiny insects (fruit flies) to regular sized insects (flies, wasps, spiders, etc.). Needless to say, we've eliminated most of our issues in just a matter of a few days! If you're looking to eliminate problematic pests, I definitely recommend using one of these! They absolutely do the job! I give it a 100 !",
