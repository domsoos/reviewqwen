    "review": "I had ordered UK size 5 which, according to size guide, is brand 34-35. I received one with size 36-37 and obviously it's big and uncomfortable to walk around in. I tried exchanging for the correct size and the one that came was again 36-37. So the size guide for this is wrong. Other than that, everything else is good. It's soft and plush, and the sole is rubbery plastic, so the sole doesn't soak water.",
    "expected-output": "The seller describes the Hometop French Terry Slippers as a high-quality product with features such as a moisture-wicking lining, memory foam insole, and a secure fit, making them suitable for various seasons. The slippers are marketed as providing comfort, warmth, and stability, ideal for relaxation and gifting occasions. However, the buyer’s review indicates dissatisfaction with the sizing. Despite ordering UK size 5 (brand size 34-35 as per the size guide), they received size 36-37 twice, which was too large and uncomfortable to use. While the buyer praises the softness, plushness, and water-resistant sole, the incorrect sizing renders the product less useful for its intended purpose.The discrepancy lies in the incorrect size being delivered and a potential error in the size guide mentioned by the seller. This indicates a fault on the seller's part for either mislabeling sizes or not ensuring accurate delivery. The buyer’s dissatisfaction is valid, as the issue significantly impacts the usability of the slippers.",
