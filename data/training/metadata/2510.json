    "Review": "The kayak\u2019s seams began leaking within a few hours, and it barely stayed inflated. Not usable for outdoor activities.",
    "Expected-output": "The buyer's images depict leakage along the seams, which undermines the seller's assurance of a 'durable and lightweight' kayak. The discrepancy between the seller's promises and the delivered product indicates the fault lies with the seller for not ensuring the product's functionality.",
