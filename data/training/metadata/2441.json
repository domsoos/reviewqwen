    "review": "I purchased these to save my sanity as an apartment dweller who is sensitive to noise, and they definitely do the job. No more unsettling thumps and bangs from neighbors, my nervous system is thrilled with these. I can still slightly hear my fridge running or occasional loud car, but its incredibly toned down. Otherwise I can't hear the sounds of others at all.The sound quality for music is amazing! I didn't get them for music but have found myself listening to it often because it sounds so good, the tones are rich and I hear details in songs I hadn't noticed before. Also great for meditation whether you want frequency tones or silence.I will disclose the first pair I recieved was defective, with a glitchy buzz tone developing quickly in one earphone. They were also super tight fitting. The company was very quick to respond, agreeing it sounded like just a bad pair, and directed me to recieve a replacement, which I actually got the next day! The new pair is super comfy to wear and perfect sound. So definitely reach out to them or amazon if yours dont seem right. They also come with a lifetime warranty! Can't beat it for $30\u200b",
