    "review": "I needed an ultraportable mouse for my work laptop and have always stood by Logitech Products. I got this for $10 and this is awesome for the price. It might not have multi-point bluetooth like other modern logitech mouses which are more expensive but the fact that it's Bluetooth 5.0 LE capable and can be paired w/ a modern Logi Bolt USB Receiver (sold separately) is awesome; most of Logitech's products that are Logi Bolt Compatible start at $30 or more.The Logi Bolt USB Receiver's tend to have farther range & less latency than your device's built-in bluetooth so if you're someone like me running powerpoints in board rooms from substanial distances (20 ft+) where I find that my laptop's natural built-in bluetooth connection gives noticeable latency, I will sometimes use a Logi Bolt USB receiver as backup (you can buy the Logi Bolt USB receiver separately and pair it w/ this mouse through the Logi Options + & Logi Bolt Software). I had a spare usb receiver lying around was able to pair the mouse using both normal bluetooth & logi bolt usb receiver pairing to test out.If you're looking for a mouse that can switch between multiple devices rapidly & simultaneously (meaning the Logi Flow Multi-Device Control Feature), look at other products in logitech's lineup but if you really plan on using this mouse for primarily one device, this is great!It's very light, compact, and small. The graphite color is nice and neutral enough to pair well with any laptop. Perfect to slip in a suitcase/backpack for an on-the-go professional or student. Logitech makes reliable keyboards and mouses that rarely fail so buy w/ confidence! Definitely a good value proposition deal in their product line",
    "Expected_output": "The Logitech M185 Wireless Mouse demonstrates remarkable alignment between the seller's promises and the buyer's review, supported by matching visuals. The seller emphasizes a compact, ergonomic design suitable for both right- and left-handed users, with a durable and reliable build that enhances productivity over touchpads. The features such as a year-long battery life, smart sleep mode, universal compatibility, and plug-and-play simplicity are clearly stated. The buyer confirms these aspects, particularly appreciating the portability, lightweight nature, and suitability for professionals or students on the go. Additionally, the buyer notes the compatibility with Logitech's Logi Bolt USB Receiver, enhancing the mouse\u2019s usability, a detail that indirectly complements the seller's focus on universal adaptability. Visually, the seller\u2019s images display the sleek design, and the buyer\u2019s images verify the product\u2019s appearance and functionality. The buyer's detailed account about using the mouse in professional settings and its seamless integration with modern technology validates the seller's description. While the buyer points out the lack of advanced multi-device features, this is a minor observation rather than a dissatisfaction, as the product aligns well with their specific needs. There are no discrepancies between the seller's promises and the buyer\u2019s experience. Both the seller and buyer have successfully met each other\u2019s expectations. The seller delivers the product as described, and the buyer finds great value, reflecting a scenario where the seller is not at fault, and the buyer is fully satisfied.",
