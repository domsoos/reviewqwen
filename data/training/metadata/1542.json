    "review": "There was a hole on the packet, god knows what made that hole most probably a rat which then proceeded inside to nibble on the dog food. This greatly compramises the quality of good and safety. Only that was disappointing.",
    "expected-output": " The seller describes Pedigree Dry Dog Food as a high-quality product offering complete and balanced nutrition with essential nutrients for dogs. However, the buyer received a packet with a hole, suspected to be caused by a rat, leading to significant concerns about the product's safety and quality. This packaging damage compromises the food's integrity and raises issues of contamination and mishandling during storage or transportation. While the product itself may align with nutritional promises, the damaged packaging undermines trust in its delivery.",
