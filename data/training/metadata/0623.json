    "expected-output": "Seller’s Description: The product, branded as DEZIN, is presented as a versatile, environmentally friendly, and easy-to-clean electric cooking pot with a 1.5-liter capacity. It emphasizes the non-stick coating for convenient cooking and cleaning, suggesting it promotes healthier cooking by reducing the need for oil. Additionally, it claims to be durable and safe with features like over-heating protection and boil-dry protection, making it an ideal choice for dormitory or travel use. 2. Seller’s Image: The seller’s image highlights the pot’s non-stick nature, where food residue can be easily wiped away with a sponge, implying a high level of durability in the coating and a clean, scratch-free surface after use. 3. Buyer’s Experience: The buyer’s review starts with a positive note, acknowledging the product’s convenience and usefulness. However, they report an issue with the non-stick coating, which started to peel after just 2.5 months. The buyer mentions that they used only wooden chopsticks and gentle detergent (Dawn) for cleaning, suggesting that they took reasonable precautions to preserve the non-stick surface. 4. Buyer’s Image: The buyer’s image shows visible wear on the non-stick coating, with peeling evident in certain areas. This contrasts with the seller’s advertised image of a pristine, durable, non-stick surface, casting doubt on the product's long-term durability. Conclusion: Based on the seller’s description and the buyer’s experience, there is a clear discrepancy in product durability. While the seller promotes the pot as a durable and high-quality non-stick cookware item, the buyer’s experience reveals issues with the coating’s longevity. This discrepancy may indicate either a flaw in manufacturing or an overstatement of the product's durability. The buyer's dissatisfaction appears justified, as they have used the product with care, adhering to recommended practices to preserve the coating. This suggests that the issue lies more with the product’s quality than with the buyer’s handling of it. In conclusion, while the product meets the basic expectations for convenience and cooking functionality, the durability of the non-stick coating falls short, leading to buyer dissatisfaction after a relatively short period of use. The fault lies with the seller due to the discrepancy between the advertised durability of the non-stick coating and the buyer's experience of it peeling after only 2.5 months of careful use. Despite the seller's claims of a durable and high-quality surface, the buyer observed significant wear, suggesting a shortfall in the product's quality or longevity, which is beyond the buyer's control.",
