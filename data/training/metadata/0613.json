    "review": "This is the second time these grinders broke. The internal gear shatters. These were bought April 3rd and only lasted a month.",
    "expected-output": "Seller Description vs. Buyer Experience: Product Durability: The seller claims the electric salt and pepper grinders are of high quality and suitable for regular kitchen use. They also emphasize a \"200% Quality & Money Back\" guarantee, suggesting confidence in the product's durability. However, the buyer\u2019s review and accompanying images show that the product's internal ceramic rotor shattered, indicating a potential flaw in durability or quality. The fact that this is the buyer's second experience with a broken grinder within a month suggests an issue with product consistency or material quality. Automatic Operation and Ease of Use: The seller emphasizes features like the gravity sensor switch and LED light, which are intended to make the grinders convenient and enjoyable to use. While the buyer does not mention these specific features in the review, the breakage of internal components, especially in a product meant for repetitive use, significantly diminishes the intended ease and functionality promoted by the seller. Adjustable Coarseness: The seller promotes the product's adjustability for different coarseness levels through a high-quality ceramic rotor. This adjustable feature should enhance user control and experience. However, with the rotor breaking, this function is compromised, and the user is unable to fully utilize the product as advertised. Quality Assurance: The seller\u2019s promise of a \"100 days free replacement & money back\" policy suggests confidence in product quality and aims to assure the buyer of risk-free purchasing. However, based on the buyer's disappointment and the product breaking twice, it appears this quality assurance does not fully translate to the product's actual performance. Conclusion: The buyer's dissatisfaction stems from the product's repeated breakage, specifically in its internal mechanism, which contradicts the seller's claims of high-quality and reliable design. The grinder\u2019s ceramic rotor and other internal components seem prone to breaking under normal use, an issue not adequately addressed by the seller's quality assurance statements. While the design and features, such as the LED light and adjustable coarseness, may appeal to potential buyers, the underlying issue of durability detracts from the overall user experience. In this case, the fault likely lies with the product's material quality or manufacturing consistency, rather than user misuse, as evidenced by the buyer experiencing repeated breakage. The buyer's experience reveals a significant gap between the seller's promises and the product's real-life performance, resulting in a justified negative review.",
