    "seller_description": "This Classic Mosquito Net for Double Bed (King Size 200cm x 200cm x 145cm or 6.5ft x 6.5ft x 4.7ft) provides effective protection for 2 adults and 1 child. Made from superior-quality, tightly woven 50 denier, 30 GSM polyester, it ensures durability and clear visibility. The self-supporting PVC-coated steel spring frame is corrosion-resistant, washable, and easy to install or fold down. Featuring long-lasting zippers and double-stitched lining, it stays as good as new even after washing. Available in two additional sizes: Queen Size (6.5ft x 5.5ft x 4.5ft) and Single Bed (6.56ft x 3.9ft x 4.2ft) to suit different needs. Comes with a convenient storage bag for portability.",
    "review": "The mosquito net has a very poor design; it feels more like a temporary fix than a durable product. It is flimsy and falls over even with minor adjustments, completely failing to serve its purpose.",
    "Expected-output": "The buyer's images reveal a mosquito net with visible tears and a lack of structural integrity, which does not align with the seller's description of 'durability' and 'superior-quality fabric.' The seller's images depict a clean and sturdy product, while the buyer's images show wear and significant damage. Although the seller highlights corrosion-resistant PVC-coated steel spring, the buyer's dissatisfaction stems from the net's structural failure, suggesting the seller's product did not meet the promised quality standards.",
