    "expected-output": "The seller describes the Paragon men's flip-flop slippers as lightweight, durable footwear designed for comfort and reliability, especially during the rainy season. With specifications like a weight of 336 g and dimensions of 30 x 11.2 x 5 cm, the product emphasizes practicality and style. However, the buyer's review mentions that while the product is 'nice,' the white strap ('patty') detached within one month of use. This indicates dissatisfaction due to the durability not meeting the expectations set by the seller's description, which promised reliability and long-lasting comfort. The failure of the strap within a short time frame reflects a discrepancy between the seller's claims and the product's performance. The fault lies with the seller for not delivering a product that aligns with the advertised durability, leading to a subpar experience for the buyer.",
