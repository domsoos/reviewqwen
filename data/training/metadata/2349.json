    "seller_description": "These women's walking shoes combine comfort, durability, and functionality to support your daily activities. Featuring a thick EVA foam midsole, they provide exceptional rebound and shock absorption, reducing pressure and impact on the joints with a thickened, soft insole for enhanced comfort. Designed for convenience, the out-turned collar and elastic no-tie laces allow for easy on-and-off wear with minimal effort. The X-shaped TPU anti-torsion plate in the midsole ensures enhanced stability and prevents twisting, reducing the risk of sprains, while the 3D textured design strengthens the upper for a secure and durable fit. Crafted with a breathable and skin-friendly layered mesh fabric upper, these shoes optimize air circulation, while the Lycra fabric interior minimizes friction for all-day comfort. The textured rubber outsole offers superior slip and abrasion resistance, ensuring safety and durability during extended walks. Combining style and functionality, these shoes are the perfect choice for walking, jogging, or everyday wear.",
    "review": "These shoes were EXACTLY as described\u2026..great quality, very comfortable, and they just slip right on. The laces are tucked away in the shoe\u2026so no tying your shoes\u2026.another great feature. HOWEVER, you need to order a half size up from what you regularly wear. I wear a 7-1/2 and they were too small (big toe touched the top). Seller was so kind to exchange very quickly. So I ordered a size 8 right away. I received them within 2 days along with my refund for the first pair. Great seller with a great product. Thinking about a second pair, too. HIGHLY RECOMMEND",
