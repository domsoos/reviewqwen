    "review": "The figurines are too small to even notice as decor. I expected them to be larger and more prominent in the room.",
    "Expected-output": "The seller's description highlights the handcrafted quality and feng shui attributes of the figurines. However, the buyer's dissatisfaction seems to stem from a personal expectation regarding size, which isn't explicitly misrepresented in the seller's description. The seller is not at fault as the product aligns with the description and images provided.",
