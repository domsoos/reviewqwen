    "review": "The product was good. The issue is I sent this product to my friend, but she didn’t receive the gift pack letter. I wrote a letter for her. The material is a bit thin compared to the market; should go offline to search for this.",
    "expected-output": "The buyer’s review indicates satisfaction with the product itself, noting the bag’s good quality, but mentions an issue with the absence of a gift pack letter, which was expected when the item was sent as a gift. Additionally, the buyer feels the material of the bag is thinner than anticipated compared to similar products found in the market. The seller’s description highlights the durability and practicality of the bag, suggesting that it is made from high-quality material, though the buyer’s experience contradicts this slightly in terms of material thickness. The absence of the gift pack letter could be a packaging error, but the quality concern regarding the material seems to be more about personal preference, with the buyer indicating that shopping offline might have helped in better assessing the material. Therefore, the fault here seems to lie with the seller regarding the packaging, while the buyer's expectation regarding the material may differ from what was provided.",
