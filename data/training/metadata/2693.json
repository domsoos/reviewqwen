    "review": "The dumbbells arrived covered in dirt and with visible cracks on one of the weights. They seem poorly made, and the quality is not what I expected for the price.",
    "Expected-output": "The seller images depict clean and durable dumbbells with no visible defects, aligning with the seller's description of premium-quality PVC dumbbells. However, the buyer images show cracked and dirty dumbbells, which contradict both the seller's images and description. This indicates that the product delivered does not meet the seller's promised quality. Here, the seller is at fault for delivering a substandard product.",
