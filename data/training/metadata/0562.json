    "review": "Let me start by saying, this is a Gifts From The Heart donation/purchase requesting non-perishable snacks. Great gift right? Wrong! Some of the individual packs are open (see pic) and one has like 3 animal crackers and the package is pancake flat (pic also provided). I am happy that I opened the box to use the snacks as filling in the loosely packed care package. So disappointing that every little thing needs to be inspected and there is zero quality check on the production end. Happy Holidays, inspect this product if you are putting in kids lunchbox.",
    "expected-output": "Seller's Description: The seller advertises the Nabisco Team Favorites Snacks Variety Pack as containing 30 individual snack packs, featuring CHIPS AHOY! Mini, OREO Mini cookies, Teddy Grahams Honey, and Barnum's Animal Crackers. These are bite-sized treats ideal for on-the-go snacking, intended as convenient and shelf-stable snacks that can be easily packed for kids and other occasions. The seller emphasizes quality and the variety of snacks available, promoting them as reliable for filling lunchboxes or care packages. Buyer's Experience and Review: The buyer received this product as part of a gift donation package, but their experience was disappointing. They noted that some individual snack packs were already opened, and one of the Barnum's Animal Crackers packs was almost empty with only a few crackers inside. This led the buyer to question the quality control on the product, especially considering it was meant for children and required extra inspection to ensure safety and quality. Discrepancies and Satisfaction Level Packaging Quality: There is a clear discrepancy in the quality of the packaging. The presence of opened and partially filled packs is inconsistent with the seller's promise of convenient, reliable snacks. This issue suggests a lack of quality control, particularly troubling for snacks intended for children. Product Condition: The condition of the snacks inside the packaging (open or nearly empty) indicates either a packaging or handling problem, which is significant given that the product is advertised as a secure, snackable option for kids. Buyer Satisfaction: The buyer is dissatisfied due to concerns over safety and quality control, which are particularly relevant for snacks meant for kids. The buyer’s disappointment stems from the fact that this product was intended as a gift, and they had to inspect every pack to ensure its integrity. Conclusion The buyer’s dissatisfaction is justified and highlights a failure on the seller's part in maintaining product quality and safety. The issues observed (opened packs, missing contents) suggest a problem in packaging or handling that contradicts the seller’s promise of convenience and reliability. The buyer’s review indicates that the fault lies with the seller's product, not merely a personal opinion or isolated experience.\" The seller is at fault due to a quality control issue, as some snack packs arrived opened or partially filled, contradicting the advertised convenience and reliability of the product. This compromised the buyer's confidence in the product's safety, especially as it was intended for children, resulting in justified dissatisfaction.",
