    "review": "I found lighter  in the pant and its a used product",
    "expected-output": "The seller describes the pants as being made from an 87% polyester and 13% spandex blend, featuring an elastic waistband, adjustable inner drawstring, deep side pockets, a back zip pocket, and tapered legs with stretchy ankle cuffs, suitable for various sports and activities. The seller's images depict well-fitted, athletic-style pants in a neutral shade. The buyer's review, however, mentions dissatisfaction due to the pants being lighter in weight than expected, which affected their satisfaction. Additionally, the buyer's images show the pants in a darker shade than the seller's images, indicating a potential color discrepancy. This suggests that while the seller accurately described the design features, there may be inconsistencies in product weight and color representation that could impact buyer satisfaction.",
