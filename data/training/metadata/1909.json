    "seller_description": "This lightweight trolley luggage features a textured, scratch-resistant polycarbonate shell and contrast beading for a premium look. It is equipped with a fixed combination lock and 8 wheels for smooth maneuverability. With dimensions of 66x46x27 cm and a sleek graphite blue color, it meets most domestic check-in size requirements.",
    "review": "I bought this Safari product with a 5-year warranty. After only a few days of use, it started coming apart near the handle. I claimed the warranty, and they approved a replacement immediately, which was great until it wasn’t. It's now been 44 days, and I’ve had no updates on the replacement. Safari’s customer care seems clueless about when it will be dispatched, and my constant follow-ups by email and phone have been ignored. Very disappointing service for a product with such a long warranty.",
    "expected_output": "The review reflects the buyer's dissatisfaction with the product due to a defect that appeared after only a few days of use. The seller's description mentions that the luggage is made from a textured, scratch-resistant polycarbonate shell, with a combination lock and 8 wheels for smooth maneuverability, but the buyer's experience contrasts with the quality promise, as the luggage started coming apart near the handle. While the seller's warranty policy appeared favorable with an immediate approval for a replacement, the buyer's frustration stems from the lack of communication and prolonged delay in receiving the replacement, despite multiple follow-ups. The seller is at fault here, not because of the product's design, but due to poor customer service and the inability to provide timely resolution despite the warranty.",
