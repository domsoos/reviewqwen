    "seller_description": "The material offers excellent abrasion resistance, slip resistance, and is highly resistant to oil and acid, making it durable and reliable for use in challenging environments where protection against wear, slippery conditions, and harsh substances is essential.",
    "review": "MRP in product is 400 and in Amazon it is 600 plus",
    "expected-output": "The seller's description highlights the product's durability, abrasion resistance, slip resistance, and resistance to oils and acids, positioning it as suitable for challenging environments. However, the buyer\u2019s review expresses dissatisfaction with the price, noting a discrepancy between the product's MRP (400) and the price listed on Amazon (600+). While the product's quality is not questioned, the buyer is dissatisfied with the higher price on Amazon compared to the MRP. The discrepancy here is related to pricing, which is an issue with the seller\u2019s listed price on the platform rather than the product's quality. The fault lies with the pricing inconsistency.",
