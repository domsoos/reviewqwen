    "expected-output": "The seller highlights the kitten food as made with high-quality ingredients and a specially formulated blend of nutrients to support a shiny coat, better eyesight, healthy growth, and high energy levels, free from artificial flavors or preservatives to promote a healthy start for kittens. The buyer, however, mentions that their 3-month-old kitten does not seem to like the food and is not eating it, indicating a potential preference issue rather than a problem with the food itself. While the food is marketed as nutritious and designed to support kitten growth and energy, kittens, like human children, can be picky eaters and may have varying preferences for flavors or textures. To address such concerns, the seller could offer sample packs or smaller quantities for trial, provide feeding guidance on how to introduce new food to a kittenâ€™s diet, diversify the product range with additional flavors to cater to different preferences, and encourage buyers to contact customer support for advice, recommendations, or product exchanges if necessary. By accommodating varying preferences and offering supportive resources, the seller can better meet the needs of a diverse customer base.",
