    "review": "Won't recommend, very poor quality",
    "expected-output": "The seller describes a premium watch box made of “high-quality PU leather on the outside” and “fine velvet on the inside,” emphasizing elegance and durability. In contrast, the buyer’s terse review—“Won’t recommend, very poor quality”—highlights a significant gap between the advertised upscale presentation and the actual product they received. From a neutral standpoint, the buyer’s dissatisfaction centers on the box not meeting the promised standards, suggesting a failure to deliver the quality described. Consequently, the seller is at fault for not providing a product that matches its advertised premium features.",
