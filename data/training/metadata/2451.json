    "review": "The umbrella broke on the very first use. The handle snapped off, and it was clearly made of cheap materials. Extremely disappointed considering the premium price.",
    "Expected-output": "The seller's images showcase a robust and durable umbrella with a sturdy handle and premium materials. However, the buyer's image clearly depicts a broken handle, indicating a lack of quality and durability in the actual product. The seller's description of a 'premium and reliable design' does not align with the buyer's experience. This discrepancy highlights a failure in delivering the promised product quality, making the seller at fault.",
