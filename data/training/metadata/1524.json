    "expected-output": "The seller describes the product as formulated for house cats to promote healthy skin and a beautiful coat, with bag packaging designed to ensure convenience and freshness. It provides essential nutrients for a glossy, soft coat and overall wellness, making it ideal for maintaining skin health and optimal nutrition. The buyer notes that the product itself is good, indicating satisfaction with its quality and nutritional benefits, but highlights the worst packaging as a significant issue. They report that the packet was tampered with from the inside, causing food to spill out, and this is the second time they have encountered this issue. The buyer emphasizes the need for the seller to be more conscious about packaging, especially for food products. While the product is appreciated, repeated packaging issues significantly detract from the overall experience, raising doubts about the seller's packaging practices and product handling. The seller needs to address packaging concerns to prevent tampering and food spillage during transit. Recommendations include improving packaging to ensure it is secure and tamper-proof, implementing better quality control during packing and shipping, and providing replacements or refunds for damaged or tampered packaging to maintain customer satisfaction and trust.",
