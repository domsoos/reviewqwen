    "review": "Product is of No use, Glue isn't sticky, When we are pulling white paper it's sticked to white paper and nothing remains on the product..",
    "expected-output": "The seller's description of the G-CHARGE Foam Seal Tape highlights its durable, weatherproof, oil-resistant, and shock-absorbing features, along with a strong adhesive backing that is supposed to stick firmly and provide a reliable seal. However, the buyer's review indicates significant dissatisfaction, stating that the glue isn't sticky and that the tape failed to perform as expected, especially when the white paper backing detached without leaving any adhesive on the product itself. This clearly contradicts the seller's claim of a strong adhesive backing that sticks firmly. The buyer's experience suggests that the adhesive quality is subpar and not as described by the seller. Therefore, the fault lies with the product's adhesive quality, which does not align with the seller's promises in the description, leading to the buyer's dissatisfaction.",
