    "review": "I actually really really liked this top. It was perfect for work in the summer and got a ton of compliments on it but the second time I wore it, I realized it had a tiny hole in it which just kept getting bigger throughout the day (at work!!). Huge bummer because I was planning on getting it in multiple colors.",

Buyer's Review Analysis: The buyer initially expresses satisfaction with the sweater, noting: It was perfect for a summer work setting and received many compliments. However, the buyer encountered an issue with the quality: a small hole appeared during the second wear, which expanded throughout the day, causing disappointment.

The sweater otherwise appears as described in terms of style and fit, matching the seller’s image.

The fault lies with the product’s durability, resulting in a negative experience for the buyer despite the initial positive impression. The seller may need to review quality control to prevent similar issues.\" The seller is at fault due to a quality issue with the product’s durability, which led to the buyer’s dissatisfaction despite the initial positive impression.",
