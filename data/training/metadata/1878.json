    "seller_description": "This protective eyewear is designed for maximum comfort and safety, featuring improved air circulation through strategically placed air vents and indirect porosity to enhance internal airflow. Made from durable polycarbonate aerospace material, it is heat-resistant, impact-resistant, and perfect for high-risk environments. The high-speed particle protection of the polycarbonate lenses can resist particles traveling at 45 m/s, safeguarding the eyes from steel filings, sand, gravel, and other debris. The high-definition clear lenses ensure excellent visibility in complex environments and can be worn over prescription glasses, meeting ANSI Z87.1 standards. Additionally, the unique anti-fog coating prevents water spray formation, while the four one-way vents allow ventilation without permitting splashes, offering protection against chemical splashes and enhancing overall safety during use.",
    "review": "First impression was good but after using for sometime I felt pain at nose. I tried to adjust the strap but no use. I need to put some cotton on my nose and place the goggle.",
    "expected-output": "The seller describes the protective eyewear as comfortable, heat-resistant, impact-resistant, and providing excellent protection against particles and chemical splashes. The buyer's review, however, mentions experiencing discomfort at the nose area, despite adjusting the strap. The discrepancy lies in the buyer's discomfort, which was not addressed in the seller's description. The product's design may not be universally comfortable for all users, and the buyer's need to use cotton for comfort suggests that the fit may not be ideal. The fault appears to be with the product's design, as it didn't meet the buyer's comfort expectations. The buyer is dissatisfied due to the discomfort caused by the eyewear.",
