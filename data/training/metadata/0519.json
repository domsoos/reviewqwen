    "review": "This shirt runs large. If it came in an xsmall, I would have ordered that. It's loose through the torso, which some may prefer, but it just looks too billowy. So there is definitely room to size down. Length is long enough to cover the rear, if you like to wear this out instead of tucked. The shoulders stick out a little too much. They don't drape nicely like they do on the model. I do wonder if a smaller size would have helped with that issue. The coral red pinkish color is very pretty, and as shown.",
    "expected-output": "The seller describes this blouse as lightweight, comfortable, and versatile, with a flowy fit, split V-neckline, and summer-friendly Swiss polka dot fabric. It emphasizes a loose and breathable design suitable for casual or dressy occasions, with a flattering tunic length that can be styled tucked or untucked. The buyer, however, finds the shirt runs large, wishing for an extra small size as the fit is too loose and billowy, particularly through the torso and shoulders. Despite these concerns, the buyer appreciates the blouse's long length for rear coverage and praises the coral red color for matching the description. The main issue lies in sizing, which suggests the seller could provide more detailed size guidance or expand size options.",
