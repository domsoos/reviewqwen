    "review": "I purchased this burner for use in my garage while working on car projects. It's perfect for heating up parts or melting materials, but it does get quite hot after extended use. The cord is a bit too short, and I can't always reach the plug easily, which is annoying. I also find it a bit heavy for carrying around, but it works great for the purpose I bought it for. If you're using it in a fixed location, it should be fine. I just wish the cord was longer for more flexibility.",
    "expected-output": "The seller’s description highlights the IMUSA electric hot plate as a versatile and portable cooking solution, ideal for use in small spaces like offices or for outdoor cooking. Key features include an adjustable temperature knob, heat distribution coils, and non-slip rubber feet for stability during use. The product is designed with a compact, space-saving form and includes a power indicator light for safety. The manual advises not to use the hot plate for more than 60 minutes in a 2-hour period. However, the buyer’s review expresses satisfaction with the device for a non-cooking use case. They purchased the burner to heat parts in a garage and are generally happy with its performance, though they point out the short cord as an inconvenience. The short cord reduces flexibility, limiting where they can use the burner. The buyer also mentions that the hot plate is a bit heavy for portable use, although it works well when stationary. There are no major discrepancies between the buyer's experience and the seller's description, although the use case (for car projects) is not the intended purpose of the product. The buyer's concern with the cord length and portability is a valid consideration based on their use, but it is not a fault in the product’s design or functionality. In conclusion, the buyer is generally satisfied with the hot plate’s performance, especially in its intended capacity as a heating device, despite some inconveniences with cord length and portability. The product aligns with the seller’s description for light-duty use, but users should consider the limitations for specific non-cooking applications. The fault does not lie with the seller, as the buyer's review highlights a mismatch between the product's intended use (cooking) and the buyer’s specific use case (heating car parts). The short cord and weight are practical considerations for the buyer, but they do not affect the overall performance of the product for the intended purpose.\"",
