    "seller_description": "This stylish bag combines functionality and safety features with a sleek design. It includes a soft mesh back with 8mm foam padding for comfort, two main compartments, one slip-in pocket inside, a printed design, and a side mesh bottle holder. With dimensions of 35 x 13 x 46 cm, it offers ample space for organization. Please note, the bag is not water-resistant, making it ideal for everyday use in dry conditions.",
    "review": "Not really satisfied with the product. Didn't justify the price at all. The quality of bag is not good.",
    "expected-output": "The seller's image shows a black backpack with a white design, featuring a side mesh pocket and multiple compartments, which aligns with the description that includes the soft mesh back, foam padding, and two main compartments. The buyer's image also showcases this same backpack, confirming the visual alignment between the seller's and buyer's images. The seller's description emphasizes comfort with foam padding, functionality with multiple compartments, and the stylish design with a printed feature. However, the buyer's review indicates dissatisfaction, mentioning that the bag did not justify the price and the quality was not as expected. Despite the seller's claims of functionality and comfort, the buyer's disappointment suggests that the bag may not have met their quality expectations, and they found it overpriced. The fault seems to lie with the product not meeting the buyer's expectations for quality, possibly due to discrepancies in material or build quality, which are not explicitly highlighted in the seller's description.",
