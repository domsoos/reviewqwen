    "expected-output": "The seller advertises kitten food made with sardine, mackerel, and eggs, offering high-quality protein and enriched with Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids for healthy skin and a shiny coat. It claims to support optimum growth, better digestibility, and overall well-being while helping to control urinary pH. The buyer reported disappointment due to receiving the box in a damaged condition, rendering the product unusable. This issue points to problems with shipping and packaging rather than the product's quality. To address this, the seller should improve packaging, offer replacements or refunds for damaged goods, and enhance quality control during shipping to prevent similar issues.",
