    "seller_description": "This travel packing cube toiletry bag set includes seven pieces to meet all your packing needs: three packing cubes (large holds 8-10 shirts, medium 5-6 shirts, small 4-5 shirts), a bra/underwear bag, a toiletry bag, a laundry bag, and a zippered bag. Made from durable, tear-resistant, and waterproof nylon fabric, these packing organizers prevent wrinkles and stains on clothes while withstanding high-intensity use. Featuring smooth double zippers and a soft mesh top panel, they protect delicate items from wrinkles and odors, offer visibility for quick identification, and save time during travel. The compression buckle design ensures clothes remain neatly stored without scattering. Suitable for most carry-on bags, backpacks, and luggage, these cubes are perfect for vacations, business trips, hiking, camping, or daily storage. All pieces can be folded into the largest cube for compact storage. If unsatisfied or in case of defects, the seller offers prompt replacement and support for any issues.",
    "review": "The actual product is completely different from what you see in the photo. It's a completely useless product, material is cheap, not worth even Rs 25. It is better to use plain plastic bags or better still not use anything - definitely not this product.",
    "expected_output": "The seller's description highlights a set of durable, waterproof travel packing cubes made from tear-resistant nylon, designed to organize clothing and toiletries while offering protection from wrinkles and odors. The set includes multiple sizes of packing cubes and additional bags for items such as bras, underwear, toiletries, and laundry. The seller emphasizes the product's ability to save space, reduce wrinkles, and improve organization for various travel needs, all while providing a compact and easily stored design. However, the buyer's review is highly dissatisfied, stating that the actual product differs drastically from what was shown in the photo. The buyer criticizes the material as cheap and not worth the price, even suggesting plastic bags as a better alternative. This strong negative reaction suggests a significant disconnect between the expectations set by the seller's description and the reality of the product's quality. From the comparison of the seller's and buyer's images, there appears to be a clear discrepancy between the product advertised and the one received. The main issue lies with the perceived quality and value of the product, which the buyer believes is far below the advertised standard. Therefore, the fault in this case lies with the seller for misleading expectations and not meeting the buyer's quality requirements.",
