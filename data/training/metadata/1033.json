    "seller_description": "This pack of 6 Yonex Mavis shuttlecocks, made from durable nylon, delivers exceptional performance with a recovery time of just 0.02 seconds when smashed\u2014only 0.005 seconds slower than Yonex feather shuttlecocks and 0.008 seconds faster than standard shuttlecocks. To ensure optimal performance, Yonex categorizes Mavis shuttlecocks into three temperature ranges; this pack features the green cap, indicating a slow speed suitable for playing environments between 22\u00b0C and 33\u00b0C. Manufactured with high-quality standards, these shuttlecocks originate from Japan.",
    "review": "A completely fake product was delivered. As you can see from the pictures. Red caps, not green caps and mainly not even yonex. Some cheap fake copy of it was delivered.",
    "expected-output": "The seller advertises a pack of six Yonex Mavis 350 shuttlecocks made from durable nylon, boasting exceptional performance with a recovery time of 0.02 seconds, close to that of feather shuttlecocks. The description emphasizes high manufacturing standards in Japan and specifies a green cap, denoting slow speed for optimal use in environments between 22\u00b0C and 33\u00b0C. The seller's image displays yellow shuttlecocks with green caps, matching the description and reinforcing the brand's authenticity. However, the buyer's review expresses strong dissatisfaction, claiming the delivered product is a fake, featuring red caps instead of green and lacking Yonex branding. The buyer's image supports these claims, showing shuttlecocks with red caps that do not align with the advertised green-capped Yonex Mavis 350 shuttlecocks.This situation reveals a significant discrepancy between the seller\u2019s promise and the buyer\u2019s experience. The delivered product does not match the seller's description or images, leading to justified buyer dissatisfaction. The fault lies entirely with the seller for either delivering an incorrect or counterfeit product. The seller's failure to provide the advertised genuine Yonex product not only breaches buyer trust but also contradicts the specific details highlighted in the product description, such as branding, cap color, and quality standards. This case underscores the importance of ensuring product authenticity to maintain customer satisfaction and credibility.",
