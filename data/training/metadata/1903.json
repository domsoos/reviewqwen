    "review": "I thougt the product is pretty good for its low price, I'm satisfied with the product, I did like the color of the product and it looks good but there is no so much space in it, it is bit thick not as much,I think It is stable or capable to hold my things whis I wish to Carry in it but Packaging is not I might say It is worst, because of this worst packaging the may get damages like scratches and the delivery person is quite person,I would recommend to Amazon that they should open courier facility across Karnataka including the villages and It should correct the packaging quality",
    "expected-output": "The analysis of the seller’s description, the buyer’s image, and the buyer’s review shows that the product description and images largely align with the product received by the buyer, although there are some concerns. The seller's image and description highlight the suitcase's features, such as its textured, scratch-resistant polypropylene shell, a fixed combination lock, and the 4 wheels for smooth maneuverability. The buyer's image shows the product received matches the description visually, indicating a correct product delivery. However, the buyer's review points out dissatisfaction with the packaging quality. While the buyer is satisfied with the product itself, the packaging was deemed inadequate, resulting in potential damages like scratches, which could affect the overall experience. The buyer also suggests improvements in the packaging process and the delivery service in rural areas. The fault appears to be with the seller’s packaging process, which led to the damage during shipping, rather than the product itself. Therefore, the seller should address packaging improvements to avoid such issues in the future.",
