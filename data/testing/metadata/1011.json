    "expected_output": "The seller's description of the Nivea Body Lotion Nourishing Body Milk highlights its suitability for very dry skin, promising long-lasting moisturization with its deep moisture serum formula. The product is described as enriched with almond oil, dermatologically approved, and capable of keeping the skin hydrated for up to 48 hours. The seller's image presents a professional and clean design, emphasizing the lotion's premium features and packaging. The buyer's image confirms that the product's physical attributes align with the seller's description, including the same branding and design. However, the buyer's review mentions a damaged cap, although the pump mechanism is functional. This indicates a flaw in the packaging process rather than the product itself. The buyer expresses mild dissatisfaction with the packaging but does not fault the product's performance. Based on the evidence, the seller is partially at fault for the inadequate packaging that resulted in damage during transit. While the product itself meets expectations, the packaging quality needs improvement to ensure customer satisfaction.",
