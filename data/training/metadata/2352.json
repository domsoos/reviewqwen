    "review": "I have very sensitive skin and this is the only bar of soap my skin will tolerate. It states fragrance free on the label but it does have a faint smell which smells good. It doesn\u2019t leave any residue and it doesn\u2019t leave an odor on your skin after washing off. It also does not dry out your skin. I will continue to buy this.",
