    "review": "The bike does not achieve the promised speed of 20mph even on flat terrain, maxing out at around 15mph.",
    "Expected-output": "The buyer is dissatisfied because the performance does not align with the seller's claim of reaching speeds up to 20mph. The seller's description sets an expectation of high speed that is not met in the buyer's experience. The fault lies with the seller for overstating the bike's speed capabilities.",
