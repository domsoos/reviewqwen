    "review": "Very bad I have already ordered 2 pair earlier all are good but this time it look like cheap product road side duplicate",
    "expected-output": "The seller describes the men's casual slip-on shoes as high-quality footwear, emphasizing their breathable mesh upper, Memory Foam insole, and Pillo Foam outsole for comfort and durability. The shoes are marketed as stylish, versatile, and perfect for various occasions, with easy maintenance to keep them fresh and functional. However, the buyer's review indicates dissatisfaction, stating that while previous orders of the same product were satisfactory, the current pair appears to be of inferior quality, resembling a roadside duplicate.This directly contradicts the seller's claim of consistent quality and high standards.The discrepancy lies in the buyer's experience of a perceived decline in product quality, leading to dissatisfaction. Since the buyer has had positive experiences with the product in the past but found the current pair substandard, the fault lies with the seller or manufacturer for potential inconsistencies in quality control. This inconsistency undermines customer trust and highlights the need for stricter quality assurance to maintain the brand's reputation.",
