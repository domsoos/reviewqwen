    "seller_description": "This set includes 10 grey shoe bags made from water-resistant and dirt-proof nonwoven material, ensuring your shoes stay protected during travel.

Crafted from high-quality materials, these shoe bags are a must-have travel accessory, perfect for organizing and protecting your footwear on the go.",
    "review": "The feature that u can look at a shoe without opening is the only good thing . Quality of the pack is very poor and extremely delicate . While opening and closing the pouch things come off . So each pouch may last just 2-3 times of use.",
    "expected-output": "The buyer's review expresses dissatisfaction with the quality of the shoe bags, stating that while the transparent window feature is useful, the overall quality is poor and the bags are delicate. The buyer mentions that the pouches may only last 2-3 uses before falling apart. This feedback contrasts with the seller's description, which claims the bags are made from high-quality, durable materials. The discrepancy suggests that the seller's promises about the durability and construction of the bags may not have met the buyer's expectations, leading to dissatisfaction. In this case, the fault seems to lie with the product quality as described by the seller.",
