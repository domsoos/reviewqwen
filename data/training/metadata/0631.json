    "expected-output": "Seller Description and Images The seller provides a description of the Imusa Electric Single Burner, highlighting features such as adjustable temperature control, a power light indicator, and non-slip rubber feet. The product is presented as portable and ideal for both indoor and outdoor use. It also mentions a stainless steel drip pan that is supposedly easy to clean, a safety feature regarding usage limits (not recommended for more than 60 minutes within a 2-hour period), and a compact design suitable for limited spaces. The images from the seller show a clean, unused burner with a black coil and reflective stainless steel drip pan, showcasing a pristine and functional appearance. Buyer’s Experience and Images The buyer’s review reveals a significant discrepancy from the seller's depiction. The buyer expected a new, unused burner but received one that appears heavily used, as indicated by rust and residue on the coil and drip pan. The buyer’s image shows a worn-out burner, which starkly contrasts with the pristine product displayed in the seller’s images. The buyer expresses dissatisfaction, as the product was not advertised as used, nor was there any indication in the description that it would be a refurbished or previously used item. Discrepancies and Evaluation Condition of the Product: The primary discrepancy lies in the condition of the burner. The seller’s description and images present a new, undamaged product, while the buyer received a visibly used and worn-out item. This mismatch in expectations has led to the buyer’s dissatisfaction. Expectation of New Product: The buyer expected a brand-new product, which aligns with the general practice on most retail platforms unless otherwise stated. However, receiving a used product without prior notice led to a negative experience. The buyer’s frustration is valid, as there was no indication in the listing that the product might be refurbished or previously owned. Functionality and Usability: While the review does not provide information on the functionality of the burner, the primary concern revolves around the product's condition. The buyer’s complaint focuses on receiving a product that does not match the description or visual representation by the seller. Conclusion The buyer is justifiably dissatisfied with their purchase. The seller’s listing appears misleading, as it advertises a new product without any mention of the item possibly being used. This lack of transparency led to a significant discrepancy between the buyer’s expectations and their actual experience upon receiving the product. To prevent such issues, the seller should explicitly indicate if a product is used or refurbished, ensuring that the description aligns with the product’s actual condition. The fault lies with the seller. The product was advertised as new, but the buyer received a used or refurbished item, which significantly deviates from the seller's description and images. The lack of transparency regarding the product's condition—whether it was new or used—led to the buyer's dissatisfaction. The seller should have explicitly mentioned if the item was refurbished or previously used to avoid misleading the customer.",
