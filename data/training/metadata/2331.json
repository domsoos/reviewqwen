    "seller_description": "No matter how your world is changing, you can always count on the quality of Swiss Miss. While Swiss Miss may be known for other powdered beverages, they also offer a delicious powdered milk with Swiss Miss Nonfat Dry Milk With Vitamins A and D. This pantry staple is an excellent source of calcium, contains no fat, 80 calories and 8 grams of protein per serving. Not only can it be used to make liquid milk, it is perfect for coffee, baking and more. No emergency food supply is complete without this amazing survival food. It is also great for camping, hiking and travel. Swiss Miss: They're so much more than cocoa",
    "review": " it is AWESOME for use in cafe lattes. It froths up really well. Makes a sturdy froth that tops off my espresso gorgeously. I just use a simple milk frother to make super quick easy foam. If you order from the warehouse you have to know that it may have a short shelf life left on it (though should be a ways out if ordering from regular Amazon). Taking a chance on reduced pricing. I think this is a bargain at regular pricing. HUGE container. I normally don't care about the best by date, because it is only referencing the guaranteed quality, not the safety. So mine is 2 months out, and I doubt I will have this used by then. But it will be fine beyond that. I bought this more as a back up in case of scarcity or skyrocketing food prices. I normally just drink non dairy milk, but will use stuff like this in recipes that call for dairy milk. I also dont mind it as a creamer.One thing that is nice about powdered milk is being able to make it as rich and creamy or as light and bland as you want. Use more or less according to preferred taste. I think this has very good flavor.I have used it directly in coffee with some effort to get lumps out. Best when use a little frother mixer. Nice for adding to smoothies and such if looking to boost protein and other vitamin and minerals. Might be helpful to those that can use the extra calories and nutrition boost without having to consume added volume (thinking ill or elderly).I'd get this again. I have two big containers so it might be awhile. But I may buy extras and give away.",
