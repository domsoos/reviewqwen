    "review": "Colour is okay but they should replace or refund the item .I am unhappy with service.",
    "expected-output": "The seller's description emphasizes the scrub suit's quality, comfort, and functionality, mentioning its fade and wrinkle-resistant material, ideal fit, and practical design features such as four pockets. The buyer's review suggests that while the color is acceptable, they are unhappy with the service and are dissatisfied with the product's return or replacement process. There seems to be no issue with the scrub suit's quality or color, but the buyer's frustration lies with the seller's customer service, particularly regarding returns. The fault in this case appears to be with the seller's handling of returns and customer satisfaction, rather than with the product itself.",
