He does not have other health issues. I have apprehension about quality of the product because if drools is a balanced diet why my dog remains physically the same? I want my dog to put in some weight after consuming a sack full aporoximately 400-500 grms per day.",
    "expected-output": "The seller promises a dog food product made with real chicken, fish oil, essential amino acids, and 100% organic minerals, claiming it promotes optimal growth and muscle development, suitable for all breeds. However, the buyer's experience reveals concerns. Although the dog consumes the food well, the German Shepherd remains thin and lean despite finishing a large quantity of the product. This raises questions about the food's effectiveness in meeting its nutritional claims. While the product is consumed willingly, the lack of weight gain suggests potential issues with either the food's formulation or the dog's specific dietary needs. The buyer recommends consulting a veterinarian or reassessing the product's suitability for dogs with higher nutritional requirements",
