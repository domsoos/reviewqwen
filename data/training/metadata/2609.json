Cleaning is simple using white vinegar, baking soda, and a microfiber cloth to maintain its sleek appearance. Note: This kettle does not include a water level indicator.",
    "review": "The kettle does not come with an automatic tea brewing feature, which I think should be a standard inclusion for all kettles.",
    "Expected-output": "The seller's description highlights the stainless steel body, 360\u00b0 swivel base, 1.5-litre capacity, and rapid boiling feature, but it does not mention or promise an automatic tea brewing feature. The buyer\u2019s dissatisfaction stems from an expectation that was never advertised or promised by the seller. The buyer's images show that the kettle matches the seller\u2019s images and description in all visible aspects. This dissatisfaction appears to be a subjective opinion rather than a failure to deliver on the part of the seller.",
