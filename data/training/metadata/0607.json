    "seller_description": "Brand: Amazon Basics: Color: Black and Sliver, Special Feature: Automatic Shut-Off, Package Information: Kettle, Finish Type: Glass,Steel, Capacity: 1.7 Liters, Material: Stainless Steel, Glass, Plastic, Voltage: 120 Volts, Wattage: 1500 watts, About this item: Electric kettle with a 1.7-liter cordless glass carafe, Quickly heats water; great for making herbal tea, hot chocolate, instant soups, and more, Handle stays cool to the touch, Safety includes auto shut-off and boil dry protection, 1500 watt heating element, Product Dimensions: 8.7 x 6.2 x 9.4 inches (LxWxH)",
    "review": "It's a year old now and I use it to heat water for tea and hummingbird nectar. The bottom started rusting within about three months and a couple months later the temperature sensor that shuts it off when it's boiling quit working so it just continues to boil forever until the water evaporates. The design of this thing is poor in that the plastic top rim extends into the interior of the kettle so that whenever you rinse it out or try to clean it any solid material stays in the kettle because it's caught underneath by the inside rim. You should probably buy one of the other kettles offered on Amazon because this one sucks.",
    "expected-output": "The Amazon Basics electric kettle is marketed as a reliable, efficient appliance with a 1.7-liter glass carafe and a powerful 1500-watt heating element, designed to quickly boil water. Key features include automatic shut-off and boil-dry protection for safety, along with a cool-to-touch handle for user convenience. The seller highlights the product's suitability for making tea, hot chocolate, and instant soups. The kettle's materials—glass, stainless steel, and plastic—are intended to give it a modern, durable look. The seller's image presents a clean, transparent kettle with clear water level indicators and a sleek design, suggesting a well-made, functional product that meets common kitchen needs. However, the buyer’s experience, as described in their review and illustrated in their images, reveals a range of issues with the kettle. After a year of use, the buyer encountered rust on the bottom of the kettle, which began to appear within the first three months. This rust issue contrasts with the seller's implied durability of the stainless steel component. Additionally, the buyer reports a malfunction with the temperature sensor responsible for shutting off the kettle once the water reaches boiling point. According to the buyer, the sensor no longer functions properly, resulting in continuous boiling until the water evaporates, creating a potential safety hazard. Furthermore, the buyer notes a design flaw with the plastic rim that extends into the kettle’s interior. This design reportedly traps solid materials underneath the rim, making it difficult to clean thoroughly. The buyer expresses frustration with these issues, ultimately recommending that others consider alternative kettles due to their dissatisfaction with this product. The images provided by the buyer show visible rust at the bottom of the kettle, aligning with the buyer's complaint about the build-up of rust and supporting their claim about durability concerns. In conclusion, there is a notable discrepancy between the seller’s description and the buyer’s experience with the product. While the kettle is advertised as durable and efficient, the issues related to rust, a faulty automatic shut-off feature, and design complications with cleaning contradict these claims. The buyer's dissatisfaction is rooted in both functional and structural issues that have impacted their experience over time, leading them to discourage others from purchasing the product. The buyer’s concerns seem valid, as the rust, sensor malfunction, and cleaning difficulty directly impact the product’s functionality and user experience, diverging from the seller’s promise of a safe and durable appliance. The fault lies with the seller and the product's design and durability. Despite the Amazon Basics kettle being marketed as a high-quality, reliable appliance, the buyer’s experience indicates significant issues with rusting, sensor malfunction, and cleaning difficulty. These defects undermine the seller’s promises of durability, functionality, and safety, justifying the buyer’s dissatisfaction over time.",
