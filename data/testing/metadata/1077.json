    "expected-output":"The seller describes the Xiaomi Trimmer 2C as a precision grooming tool offering 0.5mm accuracy, 90-minute runtime, and quick 2-hour Type-C charging. It is advertised as user-friendly, with 40 length settings, a cordless design, washable attachments, and accessories like a safety lock, pouch, and cleaning brush. The seller’s images display the trimmer and its accompanying components, aligning with the description. The buyer’s image confirms receipt of the trimmer and accessories but highlights the absence of a user manual, leaving them uncertain about the type of charger to use (regular or fast). This discrepancy indicates a lack of proper packaging or communication from the seller, leading to buyer dissatisfaction. While the product visually and functionally matches the description, the missing user manual creates a negative experience due to inadequate guidance. The fault lies with the seller for failing to include critical documentation, which undermines the buyer's ability to fully utilize the product.",
