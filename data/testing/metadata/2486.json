    "seller_description": "Keep your beverages at the perfect temperature with the Ember Mug 2, designed to provide up to 80 minutes of consistent warmth (120\u00b0F to 145\u00b0F) or all-day heating on its charging coaster. Perfect for desk use or as a thoughtful gift, this smart mug ensures your drink stays just the way you like it. Use the Ember app to set precise temperatures and receive notifications, or enjoy standalone functionality with a default temperature of 135\u00b0F and memory of your last setting for a hassle-free experience. Equipped with auto-sleep and motion sensors, the mug wakes up when hot liquid is poured and sleeps when not in use, ensuring your drink is always ready. The scratch-resistant coating makes it safe for hand washing, and its IPX7 rating allows for full submersion up to 1 meter. A smart LED indicator lets you know when your drink has reached the perfect temperature. The Ember Mug 2 is an innovative, easy-to-use solution for keeping your favorite hot drinks at their best.",
    "review": "After just a few uses, the LED stopped working, so I can't tell if the drink is at the right temperature. The quality control seems very poor for the price.",
    "Expected-output": "The seller's description emphasizes a smart LED indicator for precise temperature control, but the buyer's images and review indicate that this feature stopped functioning prematurely. The seller's promises about quality and functionality were not met, making the seller responsible for the buyer's dissatisfaction.",
