    "expected-output": "The seller's description highlights the military-style sports watch's rugged and durable features, including a shock-resistant shell, high-hardness glass mirror, and ergonomic resin band, emphasizing its suitability for outdoor activities and everyday wear. Additional functionalities like dual analog-digital display, LED backlight, and a 1-year warranty underscore its practicality and reliability for sports enthusiasts and as a versatile accessory.The buyer's review, while acknowledging the watch's overall appeal, points out a significant drawback: its susceptibility to scratches. This observation contradicts the seller's claim of a high-hardness glass mirror, suggesting a discrepancy in the watch's durability, as it does not perform as expected under normal use conditions.The images provided by the buyer and seller align visually, showcasing a watch with similar design features, ensuring consistency in appearance. However, the quality issue regarding the scratch-prone surface indicates a failure in delivering on the durability promise. In this case, the fault lies with the seller for overstating the watch's resistance to wear and tear, resulting in unmet expectations for the buyer.",
