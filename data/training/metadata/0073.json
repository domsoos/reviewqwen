    "review": "I really like how easy this razor is to use. The feel in your hand is great and working it around hard to see or reach spots is a breeze. I also love just how easily it glids through thicker, longer hair. My hair grows quickly and after a few weeks in hibernation my legs will put a man to shame. What would typically take me 2 hours, a bottle of body wash, 2 disposable razor heads, and 500 nicks to finish, took me about 25 minutes with this razor. I'd be singing this brands praises if it wasn't for one thing, the cut. When I'm done shaving my legs the best feeling ever is how soft they feel, that's my sense of accomplishment. This razor doesn't get close enough to the skin, so instead of a soft, hair free leg I'm left with a 3rd day stubble. It's frustrating and no angle or pressure works to alleviate it. What's worse is this outcome isn't just on legs, if you know what I mean. For reference, the photo shows my right leg before using this razor and the left leg shows my leg after. The stubble isn't really obvious in the photo but definitely noticeable if you zoom.",
    "expected-output": "The buyer’s review highlights several positive aspects of the razor, particularly its ease of use, ergonomic design, and effectiveness in cutting through longer, thicker hair. The buyer is satisfied with how quickly the razor accomplishes what would normally take a long time with traditional razors. However, the buyer expresses significant dissatisfaction with the closeness of the shave, stating that the razor leaves stubble, which is not expected from a shaving product. Despite the razor’s performance in other areas, the inability to achieve a smooth, hair-free leg leads to frustration. The review mentions that the stubble is noticeable under close inspection, though it is subtle in the photo. This discrepancy suggests that while the razor is effective for quick trims, it does not meet the buyer’s expectation for a clean shave. This issue seems to be more about performance than quality, indicating that the product may not be designed for a completely smooth shave. Conclusion: The fault lies with the seller, as the product description suggests a smooth shave, but the buyer's experience indicates that the razor does not achieve this result. This gap between expectation and actual performance leads to buyer dissatisfaction, particularly with the smoothness of the shave. The seller may need to clarify that the razor is intended more for trimming or maintaining hair length rather than providing a close, smooth shave. The product performs well for basic grooming, but may not meet the needs of users seeking a clean shave.",
