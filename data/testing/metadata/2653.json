    "review": "The touch control on the lamp doesn't respond consistently, and the light flickers when changing modes. Not worth the hassle for its price.",
    "Expected-output": "The buyer's review mentions inconsistent touch control and flickering light, which do not align with the seller's description of smooth touch control and non-flickering LEDs. The seller's images show a flawless lamp, whereas the buyer's images reveal possible product defects. The dissatisfaction stems from functional issues, indicating a seller's fault for not delivering as described.",
