    "review": "I bought this shaver for my cat. He doesn't mind the noise and likes to feel the vibration. It actually works quite well for his fur, though I wouldn t recommend it for facial hair or grooming yourself. It does a good job for pet grooming, but probably not what it s intended for. I also find it amusing that the pop-up trimmer works perfectly for his whiskers!",
    "expected-output": "Seller\u2019s Description vs. Buyer\u2019s Review: The seller markets the Norelco Shaver 2400 as an effective grooming tool designed specifically for facial hair, featuring ComfortCut blades, 4D Flex Heads for flexibility and comfort, a pop-up trimmer for mustache and sideburns, and a user-friendly cleaning mechanism. The product is battery-powered and provides up to 40 minutes of cordless runtime, with the option to use it plugged in for continuous power. Buyer\u2019s Review: The buyer, however, does not use the product for its intended purpose. Instead, they bought the shaver for grooming their cat. While the buyer notes that the shaver works well for their pet\u2019s fur, this is an entirely irrelevant use case, as the product is advertised for human facial hair grooming. The review does not provide any feedback on the shaver\u2019s performance for its intended use, such as shaving beards, mustaches, or sideburns. Discrepancy: There is a clear discrepancy between the seller\u2019s description and the buyer\u2019s review. The seller markets the shaver for human use, highlighting its features for beard and facial hair grooming, but the buyer focuses entirely on using the shaver for grooming a pet. This creates confusion for potential customers seeking feedback on the product\u2019s intended functionality. Conclusion: The review does not provide meaningful or relevant information about the Norelco Shaver 2400's performance as described by the seller. The buyer\u2019s focus on using the shaver for pet grooming, rather than facial hair, makes the review unhelpful for customers considering it for human use. There is no feedback on critical aspects such as the quality of the shave, comfort, or ease of use for facial grooming, which are central to the seller's description. The fault lies with the buyer in this case. The review does not address the product\u2019s advertised purpose and fails to provide useful feedback for customers evaluating the shaver for its intended use. This misalignment makes the review unhelpful for those interested in using the product for facial hair grooming.\"",
