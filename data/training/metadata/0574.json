    "expected-output": "Seller Image and Description: The seller\u2019s images show an attractive array of flavors for Sparkling Ice, emphasizing freshness, zero sugar, natural colors, vitamins, and antioxidants. The description highlights that it\u2019s a pack of 12 bottles, each offering a refreshing, low-calorie sparkling water experience. Buyer Image: The buyer\u2019s image shows bottles with an expiration date clearly printed on them, indicating they expired in November of the previous year. This image directly supports the buyer's claim of expired products. Buyer Review: The buyer expresses disappointment due to receiving expired bottles. They mention that the drinks \u201chave no gas\u201d when opened, suggesting a loss of carbonation, which would be expected from expired carbonated beverages. The buyer is clearly dissatisfied and intends to request a refund. Analysis: The buyer\u2019s complaint is valid and highlights a significant discrepancy between the seller's promise of a fresh, fizzy product and the reality of receiving expired items. The fault here lies with the seller or distributor for sending a batch past its expiration, impacting the buyer's experience. Conclusion: The buyer is dissatisfied due to receiving expired goods, which does not meet the expectations set by the seller\u2019s description. The seller is responsible, as expired products should not be sold to consumers, especially when freshness and quality are key selling points. A refund or replacement would be an appropriate resolution in this case.\" The buyer's dissatisfaction is justified due to receiving expired Sparkling Ice bottles, contradicting the seller\u2019s promise of a fresh, carbonated product. The expired date and lack of fizz upon opening indicate that the product\u2019s quality was compromised, likely due to poor inventory management or distribution oversight. This situation places responsibility on the seller or distributor for ensuring that only fresh items are shipped. A refund or replacement would be a suitable resolution to address the buyer\u2019s experience.",
