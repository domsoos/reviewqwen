    "expected-output": "The seller's description emphasizes the versatility of the digital multimeter, highlighting its ability to measure various parameters such as DC current, AC/DC voltage, duty cycle, resistance, diode, and continuity. It also mentions features like a large LCD screen, auto shut-off, and a reliable ceramic fuse for safety.The buyer's review is mostly positive, appreciating the accuracy, build quality, and included probes. However, the buyer points out a discrepancy regarding the ability to measure temperature and frequency, which the seller's description suggests is possible, but the buyer confirms it is not. The buyer does acknowledge the NCV (non-contact voltage) feature works for both AC and DC, and the product provides good value for money with the inclusion of a case.The discrepancy identified lies in the seller's description mentioning temperature and frequency measurement capabilities, which the buyer finds missing. Despite this, the buyer is generally satisfied with the product, citing its overall quality and functionality. The fault here appears to lie with the seller‚Äôs description, as it inaccurately mentions features that the product does not provide.",
