Offering 360-degree support, it helps you rest comfortably and is a must-have for posture correction.",
    "review": "The packaging was poor. The seal of the package was already open (the adhesive had gone off). The pillow doesn't have memory foam as claimed, rather cotton like fibers which will stick to your clothes and spoil them.Product is not as claimed. If you remove the cover, you will expose the inner filling.",
    "expected-output": "The seller's image shows a neck pillow with a design consistent with the description provided, including features like a removable cover and ergonomic shape. However, the buyer's image does not fully confirm the quality or material of the inner filling. The seller describes the pillow as filled with polyfilling fiber, offering neck support and comfort, but the buyer's review highlights dissatisfaction with the product. The buyer points out issues with packaging, the adhesive seal being broken, and the pillow's filling not being memory foam as advertised but rather a cotton-like fiber, which could cause discomfort and spoil clothes. Additionally, the pillow’s filling is exposed when the cover is removed, contradicting the seller's description that emphasizes its washable and hygienic design. There are discrepancies between the seller's description and the buyer’s experience. The fault seems to lie with the product not meeting the buyer's expectations, particularly regarding the materials and packaging.",
