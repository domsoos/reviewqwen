    "review": "The projector was good, but I was hoping for a realistic solar system simulation. This just throws random stars and nebulas.",
    "Expected-output": "The seller's description clearly states that the Desidiya Astronaut Galaxy Projector creates a captivating and peaceful atmosphere with stars, planets, and nebulae but does not guarantee an accurate solar system simulation. The buyer\u2019s expectations of realism might stem from their personal interpretation rather than the product\u2019s intended use. Based on the seller\u2019s images and description, the product aligns well with its specifications, making this dissatisfaction more of a mismatch in expectations rather than a fault in the product.",
