    "review": "The wiring for the battery connectors in the STEM kit was poorly assembled, with bent springs and loose connections. It was nearly impossible to get the circuits to work without manual adjustments, which frustrated my child during their attempt to enjoy the activities.",

The description of hassle-free assembly is not accurate in this case. Here, the seller is at fault for providing a defective product.",
