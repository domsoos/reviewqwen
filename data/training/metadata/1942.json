    "review": "Worst product.dont buy it.It didn't restrict water.My belongings inside the bag were wet when I opened it, highly disappointed.",
    "expected-output": "The buyer's review indicates significant dissatisfaction with the product, as it failed to meet the seller's promises of water resistance. Despite the seller describing the product as waterproof with a water-repellent coating and seamless construction designed to keep belongings dry, the buyer experienced water leakage, resulting in wet belongings. This suggests a discrepancy between the product's description and the actual performance. The fault appears to lie with the seller’s product not fulfilling the advertised claims, as the buyer's experience directly contradicts the product’s intended function. Therefore, the seller is at fault for not delivering a product that aligns with its described capabilities.",
