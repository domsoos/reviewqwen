The duster is washable, reusable, and a water-saving product, making it a practical and eco-friendly choice for maintaining your vehicle's shine.",
    "review": "Fragrance not long lasting",
    "expected_output": "The seller has accurately described the product's intended purpose as a high-quality car duster with efficient cleaning capabilities and a focus on being eco-friendly and reusable. The seller's image clearly shows a compact, neatly designed car perfume container with the name 'Involve One Musk' prominently displayed, aligning with the product's description. The buyer's image confirms that the received product matches the one depicted by the seller in terms of appearance and packaging. However, the buyer's review mentions that the fragrance is not long-lasting, which points to dissatisfaction with the product's performance rather than its physical attributes or description. This is a subjective evaluation based on individual expectations of how long the scent should last. Therefore, while the seller has fulfilled their obligation to accurately describe and deliver the product as promised, the buyer's disappointment stems from their personal experience with the product's functionality. The fault does not lie with the seller, as the product matches the description and visuals provided.",
