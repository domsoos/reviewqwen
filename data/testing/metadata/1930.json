    "review": "Pillow is ok but didn't get earplug with it.",
    "expected_output": "The seller’s image aligns with the description provided, showing a neck pillow designed for comfort, portability, and support with features like a removable, machine-washable cover and ergonomic shape. However, the buyer’s image doesn't reveal any new details about the missing earplugs. The seller describes the pillow as offering maximum support and pain relief, but the buyer expresses dissatisfaction with the absence of earplugs, which were presumably expected based on the product description or packaging. There is a discrepancy between the seller's description and the buyer’s review, as the earplugs were not included, which may be an oversight or a miscommunication. The fault appears to lie with the seller for not providing the earplugs as expected, though the pillow itself seems to meet the basic comfort requirements.",
