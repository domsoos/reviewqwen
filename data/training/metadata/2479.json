    "review": "The air fryer arrived with scratches on the glass panel and a dent on the side, which was disappointing given the premium design described. Additionally, the upper basket handle felt loose after a few uses, making it difficult to maneuver.",
    "Expected-output": "The buyer's review highlights discrepancies with the seller's description of a 'durable' and 'premium design' appliance. The damaged glass panel and dent indicate issues with either shipping or manufacturing quality. The loose handle undermines the claim of effortless functionality, leading to buyer dissatisfaction. This fault lies with the seller as the product did not meet advertised standards.",
