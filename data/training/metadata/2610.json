    "review": "I was expecting a glass body kettle, but this one is stainless steel. A glass body would have been more aesthetically pleasing.",
    "Expected-output": "The seller explicitly describes the kettle as having a stainless steel body, and the images clearly show the polished metallic finish. The buyer\u2019s expectation of a glass body is inconsistent with what was advertised. The buyer\u2019s images confirm that the kettle received matches the seller\u2019s description and images. The dissatisfaction here is due to a personal preference and not a misrepresentation by the seller",
