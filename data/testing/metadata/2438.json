But I wanted to make sure everything worked correctly and wasn't broken when I received it, so I plugged it up in my kitchen. After having it turned on for literally 1 minute, the room just felt warm (not hot) and homey. it kind of freaks me out how calming and relaxing the energy from this lamp makes me feel lol. Beautiful, natural, pretty, warm glow! just arrived today, and so far, I'm finding it beautiful. As to appearance, it's lovely, and soothing. The dimmer switch allows for a few different settings to adjust how bright you'd like it to go. I just turned it on and it's sitting nearby, with quite wonderful glow. The best gift you'll ever give! I fell in love with this lamp after seen it in a magazine and have given it as a Christmas, and a just because gift and it is a hit every time. A beautiful lamp I was a little concerned about the leakage that people seemed to be reporting. This seems to be a natural result of the salt lamp, depending on its environment. Though my room isn't humid during the winter. A must for my stuffy apartment. this lamp spends all night dimmed on my bedside table. I've really appreciated the soft light in the room, and I've noticed a difference in air quality. It seems to be solidly built. I've owned this lamp since August 2016, and it still looks new out of the box. Thank you very much for your time! what is in the boxes x 15-watt light bulb 1 x Himalayan salt night lamp with dimmable switch. 1 x user manual of salt lamp ",
