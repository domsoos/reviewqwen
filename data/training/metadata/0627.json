    "review": "The beater broke after three uses. All I make is cake batter. I've had other hand beaters that the beaters outlast the machine. What is going on?",
    "expected-output": "The seller's description highlights a few primary features: the inclusion of 2 beaters and a whisk, which are stored in a snap-on case for convenience, allowing for organized and easy storage. The hand mixer is advertised with six speed options and a QuickBurst feature for added power. Additionally, the 250-watt motor is positioned as capable of handling various mixing tasks, and the Bowl Rest feature is designed to prevent countertop messes. The seller's images corroborate the description, showing the hand mixer with two beaters, a whisk, and a compact storage case. The design suggests a well-integrated storage solution and practical features for typical kitchen needs. Buyer’s review expresses dissatisfaction with the durability of the product, specifically mentioning that the beater broke after only three uses. The buyer states that they primarily use it for mixing cake batter, a relatively light task for most mixers. They compare this experience unfavorably to previous hand mixers, where the beaters typically outlasted the motor, indicating an expectation of higher durability for the beater attachments. The buyer’s image supports their review, showing a damaged beater where one of the metal loops has separated, implying poor construction or materials that could not withstand routine use. This issue seems inconsistent with the seller’s promise of a “powerful mixing performance” and durable design. In conclusion, there is a significant discrepancy between the seller’s portrayal of durability and the buyer’s experience. The product’s materials and construction quality appear to fall short of expectations set by the product description. The buyer’s dissatisfaction is rooted in the product's failure to endure basic mixing tasks, which suggests a possible issue with the quality of the attachments rather than misuse by the buyer. The fault lies with the seller in this case. The product did not meet the durability expectations set by the seller’s description, as the beater broke after light use, despite being marketed as a durable, powerful mixer. The discrepancy suggests an issue with the quality of the attachments rather than misuse by the buyer.",
