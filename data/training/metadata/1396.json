Buyer's Review Analysis The buyer's review highlights issues with the condition of the product: 'The weights were very dirty and clearly used earlier by someone.' This suggests that the product may have been used or pre-owned rather than new, as expected. 'There was dirt accumulated on the main body as well as straps on both the pieces.' The product appears to have dirty or unclean surfaces, further indicating potential issues with quality or packaging. Analysis of the Images Buyer’s Image: The image shows the dirty condition of the product, which aligns with the buyer's description. Seller’s Image: The seller’s image likely shows the product in a new condition, but the buyer's image reveals discrepancies regarding cleanliness. Discrepancies Identified Used Condition: The buyer's review indicates that the product was used (dirty, with accumulated dirt), even though the seller marketed the product as new. Quality Control Issues: There seem to be cleanliness and quality control issues, as the buyer received a product that does not meet expectations for new items. Conclusion The buyer received used or unclean products, which does not align with the seller’s description of delivering a new item.
