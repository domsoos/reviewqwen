    "review": "The washer was delivered with a cracked top lid, which is unacceptable.",
    "Expected-output": "The buyer's image shows a cracked lid, which is inconsistent with the seller's description and images of a brand-new washer. This defect likely occurred during transit or due to poor packaging. The seller is at fault as the product did not arrive in the promised condition.",
