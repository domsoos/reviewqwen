    "review": "I don't really like this toothbrush. It's too loud and it vibrates too much for my liking. I feel like it doesn't give me that smooth clean feeling, and I find the vibrations a bit uncomfortable. The brush head also feels too big for my mouth, making it hard to maneuver in the back. I won't be using this again, it's just not what I was expecting.",
    "expected-output": "The review expresses significant dissatisfaction with the product, highlighting several discomforts and frustrations. The buyer mentions the noise and excessive vibration of the toothbrush, which they found uncomfortable. Additionally, they describe the brush head as too large for their mouth, making it difficult to maneuver in hard-to-reach areas. This contrasts with the seller's description, which emphasizes ease of use and effective cleaning power. The fault lies with the seller, as the product did not meet the buyer's expectations. The buyer's discomfort and difficulty using the toothbrush indicate a mismatch between the product's advertised features and the buyer's experience. The issues with the size, vibration, and overall performance reflect a failure in meeting the advertised promises of comfort and efficient cleaning.",
