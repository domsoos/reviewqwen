    "expected-output": "The seller describes the shoes as comfortable, versatile, and stylish, emphasizing features like a breathable mesh upper, Pillo Foam outsole, and Memory Foam insole for tailored support, suitable for various activities and easy to maintain. While the buyer acknowledges the received product's perfect size, fit, and suitability for walking, they express dissatisfaction with not receiving the item they ordered. This indicates a significant discrepancy between the buyer's expectations and the delivered product. Images likely confirm this mismatch, with the buyer showcasing a different product from what was advertised. Although the received product meets some of the seller's general quality claims, the incorrect delivery undermines the buyer's trust, highlighting an issue with the seller's logistics or order fulfillment process.",
