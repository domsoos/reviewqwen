    "review": "It is very disappointed to receive a box of Kraft Macaroni   Cheese that is expired 6 months ago! Today is Feb 26, 2024 and the box shown best by Aug 29, 2023!",
    "expected-output": "Seller's Image vs. Buyer's Image: The seller's image showcases an 18-pack of Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Easy Mac, clearly labeled as such with vibrant packaging and no visible flaws. The buyer's image, however, reveals a box with an expiration date that has already passed, visible as \"Best When Used By 29 AUG 2023.\" This discrepancy suggests an expired product was shipped. Seller's Description vs. Buyer's Review: The seller's description highlights Kraft Mac & Cheese's appeal, focusing on its convenience, flavor, and freshness, with no mention of quality issues or expired stock. The buyer's review, on the other hand, expresses dissatisfaction upon receiving a product past its expiration date by nearly six months, thus contradicting the expectation set by the seller's description. Alignment and Discrepancies: The main issue here is the expiration date discrepancy, which is critical for food products. The seller promises a quality product with no mention of potential issues with product freshness, while the buyer received a product that does not meet these standards. Conclusion: Buyer Satisfaction: Dissatisfied. Fault: The dissatisfaction arises due to the seller\u2019s failure to deliver a product within the promised shelf life, which is a significant issue for consumable goods. This falls under the seller's responsibility as delivering expired food items can affect customer trust and product safety.\" The seller is at fault for sending an expired product, which contradicts the expectations of freshness and quality essential for consumable goods. This oversight led to buyer dissatisfaction and highlights a need for better inventory management to ensure products shipped are within their valid shelf life.",
