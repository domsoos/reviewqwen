    "expected-output": "The buyer's image shows a set of packing cubes, similar to the seller's image, which displays the same set in a neat, organized fashion. The seller's description emphasizes the seven-piece set, including three packing cubes, a bra/underwear bag, a toiletry bag, a laundry bag, and a zippered bag, all made of durable, tear-resistant, and waterproof nylon fabric. The buyer's review aligns well with the seller's description, highlighting the compact design, multiple compartments, high-quality zippers, and the mesh top panel that keeps items organized and odor-free. The buyer appreciates the premium feel and acknowledges the product as a gamechanger for organizing clothes and accessories during trips, mentioning its value for money. There are no discrepancies, and the buyer is highly satisfied with the product, confirming the seller's claims. Therefore, the fault, if any, lies with the buyer not recognizing the value of the product initially or the expectations regarding its usage, but the seller has provided exactly what was promised.",
