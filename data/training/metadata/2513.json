    "review": "The battery life is nowhere close to the advertised 7-10 days. It barely lasts two days, even with minimal usage, making it inconvenient for regular use.",
    "Expected-output": "The seller promises 7-10 days of battery life under heavy use, but the buyer's review contradicts this claim, citing only two days of usage. This significant deviation indicates that the product does not align with the seller's description. Fault lies with the seller.",
