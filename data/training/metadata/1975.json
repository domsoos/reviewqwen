    "review": "It’s very cheap quality product. Looking like its not a genuine leather. At offline market, product available at very low cost (around 100-120).",
    "expected-output": "The buyer's review indicates significant dissatisfaction with the product. They describe it as being of cheap quality, and they suggest it is not genuine leather, which contradicts the seller's description. The buyer further claims that similar products are available in offline markets at a much lower price, implying that the product is overpriced. This dissatisfaction stems from the discrepancy in material quality and value for money, suggesting that the fault lies with the seller for misrepresenting the product's quality and failing to meet the buyer's expectations.",
