    "expected-output": "The Amazon Basics electric kettle is advertised as a convenient and efficient appliance with a 1.7-liter glass carafe, a 1500-watt heating element for rapid boiling, and safety features such as automatic shut-off and boil-dry protection. The seller highlights that the kettle is made from glass and stainless steel, providing a sleek and modern appearance. The kettle's handle is designed to stay cool to the touch, enhancing user safety and ease of handling. Additionally, the seller emphasizes that the kettle is ideal for making tea, hot chocolate, instant soups, and other beverages. The seller’s image showcases a clean, undamaged kettle with transparent glass, a clear water level indicator, and a sturdy design. This image aligns with the seller's claims about the kettle's appearance and materials. However, the buyer’s experience diverges significantly from the advertised product. The buyer states that they received the kettle in a broken condition, as shown in the provided image. This image reveals visible cracks in the glass carafe, indicating that the product was damaged upon arrival. The buyer’s disappointment is clear in their review, as they were looking forward to using the kettle but were unable to due to the damage. This situation suggests that the issue lies in the product's handling or packaging rather than the product’s design or functionality, as the buyer could not assess the kettle's performance. The discrepancy between the seller’s promises and the buyer’s experience highlights a potential quality control or shipping issue. The product's fragile glass material may have been inadequately protected during transit, leading to breakage before it reached the buyer. This experience has led to the buyer’s dissatisfaction, as they received a damaged item that did not meet their expectations of a new and functional kettle. In conclusion, the main issue here appears to be the condition of the product upon delivery rather than a flaw in the product's design or advertised features. The seller's description accurately represents the kettle's design and intended use, but the buyer’s experience was marred by damage during shipping, preventing them from using the product. This situation underscores the importance of robust packaging for fragile items to ensure they arrive intact. The buyer's dissatisfaction is valid, as the product did not meet their expectations due to the condition in which it was received. The fault lies with the seller or the shipping process, as the Amazon Basics electric kettle arrived damaged, likely due to inadequate packaging or handling during transit. The seller's description was accurate regarding the product's design and features, but the buyer's dissatisfaction stems from receiving a broken item, which prevented them from using it. This highlights the need for better protection of fragile items in shipping.",
