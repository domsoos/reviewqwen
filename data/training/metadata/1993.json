    "review": "Sharp edges around ! Button to unlock itself is sharp and can easily cut your finger when in pocket!! Price as per quality made should not be more than 100 max! Avoid this.",
    "expected-output": "The buyer's review points out a significant safety concern with the RFID-blocking card holder, mentioning that the sharp edges, particularly around the button, could cut the fingers when handling or when the product is in a pocket. This is a serious usability issue not mentioned in the seller's description, which focuses on the product's compact design and RFID protection features. The buyer also criticizes the product's value, stating that the price is too high for the quality provided. The seller's description does not address any potential safety or quality concerns, such as sharp edges, which could have been prevented with better design or quality control. Given these issues, the fault appears to lie with the seller, as the product's design and quality do not meet expectations or ensure safe use.",
