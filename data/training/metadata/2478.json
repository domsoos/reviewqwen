    "review": "The headset is heavier than expected, causing discomfort during prolonged use.",
    "Expected-output": "The buyer's review highlights discomfort due to the weight of the headset, which contradicts the seller's claim of lightweight comfort. The seller's images do not convey any indication of excessive weight, resulting in a misalignment between the expectations set by the description and the buyer's experience.
