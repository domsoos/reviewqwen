    "review": "The device constantly overheats and becomes uncomfortable to use during extended gaming sessions.",
    "Expected-output": "The buyer images reveal signs of overheating issues, as the headset appears discolored and worn. The seller's description did not mention potential overheating problems, which indicates a discrepancy between the product's performance and its advertised features. This dissatisfaction is likely caused by a failure in the product's cooling system, making the seller at fault for not addressing this issue in their description.",
