    "review": "Our families new favorite snack has become Veggie Straws! My teen son was turned into them a few months ago. After that, the entire family got hooked on the 130 calorie treat! When making sensible choices, this is one we choose. It's nice to see that the total number of calories is per bag. If you look at some snacks, you may see a lower number, but there are actually multiple servings in the bag. Not the case here. 130 calories per bag. Great flavor with an awesome crunch. Love the Sea Salt flavor because it reminds me of a chip. Awesome price per case here at Amazon with a coupon and Subscribe and Save option! Convenient box fits nicely on the bottom shelf of my pantry.",
