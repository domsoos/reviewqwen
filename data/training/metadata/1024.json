    "expected-output": "The seller's description of the Portable LCD Electronic Balance Digital Scale provides a detailed account of its features, emphasizing its compact design, high accuracy, and versatility in weighing units. The images included in the listing showcase a sleek, functional device that appears to match the physical appearance of the product received by the buyer. However, the buyer's review reveals significant dissatisfaction, citing that the product stopped functioning within a year, rendering it unusable and non-repairable. This discrepancy indicates a potential issue with the product's durability or quality, which is not mentioned in the seller's description. While the seller accurately portrays the product's features and initial usability, the lack of emphasis on its longevity or warranty leaves the buyer with unmet expectations. The fault primarily lies with the seller for failing to ensure or highlight the product's durability, which would have been a crucial factor for the buyer's long-term satisfaction. The buyer's frustration is justified, given that the product did not deliver on its implied promise of reliable use over an extended period.",
