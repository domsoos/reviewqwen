    "seller_description": "This set of two stainless-steel food bowls is ideal for puppies, dogs, cats, or kittens, each with a capacity of 700 ml, perfect for dry kibble, wet food, treats, or water. Made from rust-resistant material, these bowls provide a healthy alternative to plastic and do not retain odors. Featuring a no-tip design with a rubber base, they protect floors and prevent sliding during meals. Dishwasher-safe, they ensure easy and hassle-free cleaning.",

    "expected-output": "Upon comparing the seller\u2019s description of two stainless-steel food bowls (each holding 700 ml) to the buyer\u2019s comment that they inadvertently ordered a 2800 ml size, it is clear the primary issue does not lie with the product itself. The seller accurately advertised bowls suitable for smaller portions, emphasizing rust resistance, no-tip design, and easy cleaning. The buyer\u2019s statement indicates a personal ordering mistake rather than dissatisfaction with the product\u2019s quality or features. As a result, the product remains as described, and the reason for the mismatch is attributed to the buyer\u2019s error. There is no evidence of misleading information from the seller\u2019s side, so the seller is not at fault.",
