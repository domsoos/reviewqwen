    "review": "IThe stitches look very bad. Quality is very cheap. V bad. Only buy if you want to give it to someone you hate",
    "expected-output": "The buyer is dissatisfied with the product, expressing disappointment over the poor stitching and cheap quality. This feedback contradicts the seller's description, which highlights the wallet's durable craftsmanship and high-quality leather. The buyer's experience suggests that the wallet did not meet expectations in terms of quality and construction, indicating that the seller's product did not align with the buyer's needs. The fault appears to lie with the sellerâ€™s product, as the buyer specifically mentions the stitching and quality as major concerns, which does not reflect the high standards promised in the description.",
