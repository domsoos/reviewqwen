    "expected-output":"The seller describes a high-performance SSD with read speeds up to 1050MB/s and write speeds up to 1000MB/s, intended for fast folder access and transfers. However, the buyer reports a sluggish experience—folders take too long to open, and the overall usage feels slow, prompting a return. This indicates a direct conflict between the advertised speeds and the buyer’s actual experience. From a neutral standpoint, the buyer’s dissatisfaction arises because the product does not seem to function as advertised, suggesting a mismatch in performance. While it is possible that external factors (e.g., device compatibility or cable issues) could affect speed, there is no indication in the review that the buyer misused the product. Thus, based on the available information, the seller appears to be at fault for not meeting the advertised claims or delivering a product that aligns with the buyer’s expectations.",
