    "review": "Zippos are not only classic and nostalgic they're reliable and practical.I recommend wicking every Zippo you receive properly and learn how to take care of one of these before you get one, there is a little maintenance involved but it's why your Zippo becomes your trusty companionBut if you're informed about what you're getting, this is a good place to get a Zippo! I've never purchased on from Amazon before, I got a Brushed Brass normal Zippo and it came to me beautiful and clean.Eventually a plain brass Zippo will get a patina and show wear but that's a nice look. I love a well worn one!I like the lack of plastic waste with my Zippo and the reliability in crazy weather. Learn to set and trim your wick and change a flint and you're golden.",
