    "expected-output": "The seller’s description highlights an elegant digital watch with a sophisticated design, featuring a rose gold stainless steel band and durable acrylic dial glass. It promises accurate timekeeping with quartz movement and water resistance up to 50 meters. The fold-over clasp is noted for providing a secure and comfortable fit, while the lightweight build ensures everyday wearability, aligning with its premium appeal.The buyer's review, however, indicates dissatisfaction with the watch's functionality, specifically mentioning issues with the screen failing to display some numbers. This defect undermines the seller's claims of the watch being a high-quality product with reliable performance, as accurate and clear timekeeping is a fundamental expectation for any watch.While the visual appearance of the product matches between the buyer’s and seller’s images, the discrepancy lies in the functionality of the watch. The seller’s promise of durability and practicality is not fulfilled due to the defective screen. The fault in this scenario lies with the seller, as the product failed to deliver its promised functionality, leading to the buyer's dissatisfaction.",
