    "review": "The noodles in this lime chili shrimp ramen have just the right texture and are very smooth to eat. Not only is it convenient and fast, but kids can also taste delicious food in their fast food, which is great news to me! I personally love this instant noodle and it's a regular on my family's dinner table because I can always rely on it for a delicious and easy meal, whether it's a busy weekday or a lazy weekend. The key is, Amazon.com offers affordable prices, complete packaging and fast delivery. This is the point of our frequent repurchases.",
    "expected-output": "Seller's Description The seller advertises a Maruchan Ramen box containing a variety of flavors. The specific flavor in the image appears to be \"Chicken,\" which is commonly associated with standard Maruchan offerings. Buyer's Review and Image The buyer mentions satisfaction with the Lime Chili Shrimp flavor of Maruchan Ramen, indicating it's a regular favorite for their family due to its convenience, good texture, and affordability. The image provided by the buyer shows packages of Lime Chili Shrimp flavor instead of the Chicken flavor shown in the seller's image. Discrepancy There is a mismatch between the flavors shown in the seller's image (Chicken) and the buyer's image (Lime Chili Shrimp). This discrepancy suggests that the buyer might have received a different flavor than the one displayed by the seller or that they ordered a different flavor variety intentionally. Conclusion The buyer expresses satisfaction with the product's flavor, convenience, and quality, indicating that the product met their expectations despite the flavor discrepancy. It appears that the Lime Chili Shrimp flavor was either the intended choice by the buyer or was acceptable to them, as they did not express dissatisfaction.Neither the buyer nor the seller is at fault; the buyer is satisfied with the product's flavor, quality, and convenience. The flavor discrepancy between the seller's image and the buyer's review does not impact the buyer's positive experience, as they express no dissatisfaction with the product.",
