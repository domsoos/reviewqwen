    "review": "I had lasik surgery May/2021 and these were the type of eye drops my doctor gave me. My eyes are doing amazing but they feel dry when its windy, staring at a screen for long periods of time, and when I'm in front of the air conditioner. These eye drops work wonders and help my eyes feel better, literally refreshed. They came in a box with two containers and they have a very good expiration date. I usually try to get these at costco when they have discount but offer here was great for the two bottles. Bottles were sealed and had no issues. I will definitely keep buying!",
