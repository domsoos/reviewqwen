    "review": "Utterly disgusted with this. The gravy has gone bad & is growing fungus. Did not expect this from a brand like drools. This is the type of food are we feeding to our fur baby's ? This is the second time, I only reported last month the same thing from the last batch & now again today. Really disgusting. Not going to buy this brand again . Please consider & take a look at the pictures before you think of ordering this products for your babies.",
    "expected-output": "The seller advertises this dog food as a wholesome and nutritious option that promotes joint health, bone strength, and a shiny coat, with real chicken, liver, and eggs to keep pets active and agile. It also claims to support healthy digestion and is marketed in a convenient bag container for easy storage and serving. However, the buyer's review reveals significant dissatisfaction, reporting that the gravy in the product has gone bad and is growing fungus. This issue was not an isolated incident, as the buyer previously experienced a similar problem with a prior batch, which they also reported. The buyer expresses disgust and frustration, stating that they will not purchase the brand again due to concerns about the safety and quality of the food for their pets.The discrepancy lies in the product's advertised quality and its actual condition upon delivery. The presence of fungus indicates either a flaw in the manufacturing process, improper storage, or inadequate quality control measures by the seller or brand. This poses a serious health risk to pets and directly contradicts the seller's claims of providing a nutritious and safe meal. The fault lies with the seller or manufacturer for failing to ensure product quality and safety.",
